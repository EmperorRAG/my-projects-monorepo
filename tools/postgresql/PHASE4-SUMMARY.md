**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Status**: Successfully Completed
**Build**: ✅ Passing (263 KiB webpack bundle)

---

## What Was Delivered

### 🔧 Database Management Scripts

1. **Backup Script** (`tools/postgresql/scripts/backup-db.sh`)
   - Automated backups with gzip compression
   - Maintains last 10 backups automatically
   - ✅ Tested: Creates 4KB compressed backups from 12KB SQL dumps

2. **Restore Script** (`tools/postgresql/scripts/restore-db.sh`)
   - Safe restore with confirmation prompts
   - Automatic connection termination
   - Database recreation and verification

3. **Health Check Script** (`tools/postgresql/scripts/health-check.sh`)
   - Comprehensive 10-point health validation
   - ✅ Tested: All checks passing
   - < 1 second execution time

### 💚 Health Monitoring

**New Endpoints** in `my-nest-js-auth-microservice`:

- `GET /health` - Full health check with metrics
- `GET /health/ready` - Kubernetes readiness probe
- `GET /health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe

**Metrics Exposed**:

- Service uptime
- Memory usage (heap used/total)
- Database connectivity
- Database response time

### 📝 HTTP Logging

**LoggingMiddleware** - Automatic request/response logging:

```
[HTTP] → POST /api/auth/sign-in/email - 192.168.1.1
[HTTP] ← POST /api/auth/sign-in/email 200 - 45ms
```

### 🚀 Deployment Automation

**3 New Scripts**:

1. `deploy.sh` - Full production deployment with checks
2. `start.sh` - Quick development startup
3. `stop.sh` - Graceful service shutdown

### 🔌 Prisma Integration

**Global PrismaService**:

- Dependency injection throughout app
- Automatic connection lifecycle management
- Path alias: `@my-projects-monorepo/prisma-client`

## Quick Commands

### Database Operations

```bash
npx nx health-check postgresql  # Run health check
npx nx backup postgresql         # Create backup
```

### Service Operations

```bash
bash services/my-nest-js-auth-microservice/scripts/start.sh   # Start
bash services/my-nest-js-auth-microservice/scripts/stop.sh    # Stop
bash services/my-nest-js-auth-microservice/scripts/deploy.sh production  # Deploy
```

### Health Checks

```bash
curl http://localhost:3333/health        # Full health
curl http://localhost:3333/health/ready  # Readiness
curl http://localhost:3333/health/live   # Liveness
```
