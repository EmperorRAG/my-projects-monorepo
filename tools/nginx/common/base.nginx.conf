# =================================================================================================
# Base NGINX Configuration
# =================================================================================================
#
# This file contains shared defaults and global settings that are used across all NGINX nodes
# in the monorepo (proxy-edge, lb-frontend, lb-api, lb-email).
#
# Key Features:
# - Optimized worker process configuration
# - Connection handling and timeouts
# - Gzip compression for better performance
# - Event-driven architecture configuration
# - Security-focused defaults
#
# Usage:
# Include this file at the top of each node-specific nginx.conf:
#   include /etc/nginx/base.nginx.conf;
#
# =================================================================================================

# Run nginx as a non-privileged user for security

# Worker Processes Configuration
# Set to 'auto' to automatically detect the number of CPU cores
# This ensures optimal performance across different deployment environments

# Error Log Configuration
# Logs errors to stderr for container-friendly logging
# Level 'warn' reduces noise while capturing important issues
