# Health Check Integration - Before & After

## The Problem

When running `nx run nginx:health-check`, the command was trying to check load balancers on ports that weren't exposed:

```bash
$ nx run nginx:health-check

✔  nx run nginx:health-check

# Output:
curl -f http://localhost/health || echo 'Edge proxy health check failed'
healthy  # ✅ This worked

curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || echo 'LB frontend health check failed'
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
'LB frontend health check failed'  # ❌ Failed

curl -f http://localhost:8081/health || echo 'LB API health check failed'
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8081: Connection refused
'LB API health check failed'  # ❌ Failed

curl -f http://localhost:8082/health || echo 'LB email health check failed'
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8082: Connection refused
'LB email health check failed'  # ❌ Failed
```

**Why it failed:**
- Load balancer ports (8080) are only exposed internally in the Docker network
- They are NOT mapped to host ports (8080, 8081, 8082)
- External health checks couldn't reach them

## The Solution

The gateway now exposes health check endpoints that proxy to the load balancers:

```bash
$ nx run nginx:health-check

✔  nx run nginx:health-check

# Output:
=== NGINX Health Check ===

Edge Proxy Health:
healthy  # ✅ Gateway is healthy

Load Balancer Health Checks (via Gateway):

  - Frontend LB:
lb-frontend:healthy  # ✅ Checked via gateway

  - API LB:
lb-api:healthy  # ✅ Checked via gateway

  - Email LB:
lb-email:healthy  # ✅ Checked via gateway

All health checks completed successfully!  # ✅ All components healthy
```

**How it works:**
- Gateway exposes `/health/lb-frontend`, `/health/lb-api`, `/health/lb-email`
- These endpoints proxy requests to the internal load balancers
- All checks go through the gateway on port 80 (which IS exposed)
- No need to expose load balancer ports to the host

     ✅ Can check all components via gateway
     ✅ LB ports remain internal (secure)
     ✅ Single entry point for monitoring
```

## Example Usage

### Checking All Components
```bash
# One command checks everything
nx run nginx:health-check
```

### Checking Individual Components
```bash
# Gateway only
curl http://localhost/health

# Specific load balancer (via gateway)
curl http://localhost/health/lb-frontend
curl http://localhost/health/lb-api
curl http://localhost/health/lb-email
```

### In Monitoring Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitoring.sh - Check all NGINX components

echo "Checking NGINX health..."

# Check gateway
if curl -sf http://localhost/health > /dev/null; then
    echo "✅ Gateway is healthy"
else
    echo "❌ Gateway is unhealthy"
    exit 1
fi

# Check load balancers via gateway
for lb in frontend api email; do
    if curl -sf http://localhost/health/lb-$lb > /dev/null; then
        echo "✅ LB $lb is healthy"
    else
        echo "❌ LB $lb is unhealthy"
        exit 1
    fi
done

echo "All components are healthy!"
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Problem**: Load balancers weren't accessible for health checks from outside Docker
2. **Solution**: Gateway proxies health requests to internal load balancers
3. **Benefit**: Single entry point for all health checks, improved monitoring
4. **Security**: Load balancers remain internal, only gateway port exposed
5. **Simplicity**: One command (`nx run nginx:health-check`) checks everything
