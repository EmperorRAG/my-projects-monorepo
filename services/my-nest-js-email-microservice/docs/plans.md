## System Understanding

- **Purpose**: Provides an authenticated API for dispatching SMTP emails and exposes health checks for observability.
- **Key Modules**: `AppModule` wires configuration validation, SMTP wiring, and health reporting; `EmailController` handles `/email/send`; `AppService` orchestrates DTO validation and SMTP calls; `SmtpService` wraps Nodemailer; `BetterAuthService` and `S2SAuthGuard` enforce bearer token authorization; `HealthModule` exposes `/health` with Terminus.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Global validation pipe enforces DTO rules, environment variables validated via Joi, logging uses NestJS `Logger`.

## Testing Objectives

- Verify that critical behaviors (authorization, validation, email dispatch, health reporting) work as designed across happy paths and failure paths.
- Prevent regressions in configuration wiring (e.g., provider tokens, environment schema) through targeted integration coverage.
- Ensure documentation-ready confidence by automating tests in Nx CI pipelines and supporting local developer workflows.

## Scope and Assumptions

- Assume SMTP calls are mocked or intercepted in automated suites to avoid sending real emails.
- External dependencies: Nodemailer transport, environment variables (`SMTP_*`, `API_KEY`), bearer token clients.
- Out of scope: UI-level tests (no UI provided) and performance benchmarking beyond smoke-level verifications.

## Test Environment and Tooling

- **Frameworks**: Jest with `@nestjs/testing`, SuperTest (for e2e), and ts-jest configuration already present.
- **Execution Commands**: `npx nx test my-nest-js-email-microservice` for unit/integration suites; `npx nx e2e my-nest-js-email-microservice-e2e` once e2e project is scaffolded.
- **Test Data**: Use clearly named fixtures (`valid-token`, `invalid-token`, email payloads) and environment overrides via `process.env` mocks.
- **Monitoring**: Leverage Jest reporters for coverage thresholds; optional integration with TS node mocks for Nodemailer.

## Risk Assessment

- **High**: Provider token mismatch (`SmtpService` injects `NODEMAILER_TRANSPORT` while module exports `SMTP_TRANSPORT`) will cause runtime failures; add regression tests once corrected.
- **Medium**: Guard relies on static token; ensure future JWT integration has robust tests.
- **Medium**: Validation failures need consistent 400 responses; verify pipes and Joi schema interplay.
- **Low**: Health check external ping could flake if docs endpoint changes; consider mocking HTTP indicator.

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

- **BetterAuthService**: Validate `validateToken` returns true for `valid-token`, false otherwise.
- **S2SAuthGuard**: Authorize request with correct bearer token; reject missing header; reject malformed schemes; ensure dependency mock usage.
- **SendEmailDto**: Class-validator tests covering missing fields, invalid email format, and success scenario using `class-validator` `validate` helper.
- **AppService**: Confirm `sendTestEmail` calls `SmtpService.sendEmail` with DTO-derived values; logs success; logs error and does not throw on transport failure.
- **SmtpService**: Ensure it forwards options to injected transport and propagates promise rejection.
- **Config Validation**: Directly invoke `validationSchema.validate` with valid/invalid env maps to assert required keys.

### Integration Tests

- **EmailController + Guard**: Use Nest testing module with in-memory app to POST `/email/send`; assert 202 and mock called when header valid; expect 401 for missing/invalid tokens.
- **EmailController Validation**: Send payloads with missing fields or invalid email; expect 400 with meaningful message due to global pipes.
- **AppModule Wiring**: Boot Test application verifying `SmtpService` resolves after aligning provider token; simulate transport sending stub to catch misconfiguration.
- **HealthController**: Mock `HttpHealthIndicator.pingCheck` to avoid network calls; assert structure of `/health` response and failure propagation.
- **Environment Boot Failure**: Start module with missing `SMTP_PASS` and assert `ConfigModule` throws to guard runtime misconfigurations.

### End-to-End Tests

- Spin up application with `.env.test`; use SuperTest against running Nest app to:
  - Submit authorized email request and verify 202 plus side effects (mock transport records call).
  - Attempt unauthorized call and observe 401 JSON structure.
  - Hit `/health` and confirm 200 with expected checks.
  - (Future) Add contract test for downstream SMTP stub to ensure message payload schema compatibility.

### Non-Functional and Auxiliary Tests

- **Security**: Pen-test style unit verifying guard strips whitespace tokens; confirm no logging of secrets.
- **Observability**: Snapshot logging messages or use spies to confirm meaningful log content on success/failure.
- **Resilience**: Simulate Nodemailer rejection, ensure controller still returns 202 while service logs failure (consideration for retry strategy backlog).

## Test Data Strategy

- Centralize fixtures in `test/fixtures/email.ts` (new) with reusable payloads and token constants.
- Use environment mocks to cover positive and negative validation scenarios.
- For e2e, provide `.env.test` with safe dummy values and ensure cleanup between tests.

## Implementation Backlog

- Add unit tests listed above with priority P1 for guard, DTO, and service coverage; P2 for config schema and logging verifications.
- Create integration suite using `@nestjs/testing` `Test.createTestingModule` bootstrapping with `INestApplication` for controller routes.
- Scaffold Playwright-style e2e project or extend existing e2e folder with SuperTest runner focusing on API flows.
- Introduce CI gate to require minimum coverage (e.g., 80% lines/functions) once foundational tests land.
- Document test execution steps in project README to support onboarding.
