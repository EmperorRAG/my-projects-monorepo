# Feature PRD: Asynchronous Email Sending

## 1. Feature Name

Asynchronous Email Sending

## 2. Epic

- **Epic PRD:** [../../epic.md](./../epic.md)
- **Epic Architecture:** [../../arch.md](./../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** The main API endpoint should not be blocked by the potentially slow process of communicating with an external SMTP provider. A synchronous process would lead to poor API performance and could cause request timeouts, making the service unreliable.
- **Solution:** This feature will ensure that after a request is validated, the actual email sending process is handled asynchronously. The API will immediately return a `202 Accepted` response, and the email job will be processed in the background.
- **Impact:** Drastically improves the API's response time and reliability. It decouples the API from the external SMTP provider, ensuring that the service remains fast and responsive regardless of the provider's performance.

## 4. User Personas

- **Primary User (Programmatic):** AI Agents / Backend Services that require a fast and reliable API response.
- **Secondary User (Human):** Platform Developers who benefit from a non-blocking API, which simplifies their client-side logic.

## 5. User Stories

- As a Backend Service, I want to receive an immediate confirmation that my email request has been accepted so that my own processes are not blocked waiting for an email to be sent.
- As a Platform Developer, I want the email service to be resilient to temporary SMTP provider outages so that my requests are not lost if the provider is momentarily unavailable.

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- The `EmailController` MUST NOT `await` the completion of the `EmailService`'s send method directly in a way that blocks the HTTP response.
- Upon successful validation of a request, the API MUST immediately return a `202 Accepted` status code.
- The task of sending the email via the SMTP provider MUST be executed as a background, non-blocking process.
- The system should be able to handle a high volume of concurrent requests without degrading API performance.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The API response time must remain under 200ms, even while multiple emails are being processed in the background.
- **Reliability:** The asynchronous process should include error handling to catch and log any failures during the SMTP communication.
- **Scalability:** The asynchronous design should support horizontal scaling, allowing multiple instances of the service to process email jobs.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: API Responds Asynchronously

- **Given** a valid email request is sent to the `/email/send` endpoint.
- **When** the request is processed by the controller.
- **Then** the controller should immediately return a `202 Accepted` response.
- **And** the `EmailService`'s method to send the email should be invoked asynchronously (e.g., without an `await` that blocks the controller's response, or by using a job queue).

### Scenario 2: SMTP Provider is Slow

- **Given** the external SMTP provider is experiencing high latency.
- **When** a valid email request is sent to the `/email/send` endpoint.
- **Then** the API should still respond within the 200ms performance target with a `202 Accepted` status code.
- **And** the email sending process will take longer in the background but will not impact the API's responsiveness.

## 8. Out of Scope

- **Persistent Job Queues:** For this initial version, an in-memory asynchronous process is sufficient. Integration with a persistent job queue system like Redis or RabbitMQ is out of scope.
- **Guaranteed Delivery:** While the system will have retry logic for transient errors, it will not guarantee delivery in the case of a persistent SMTP provider failure or application crash.
- **Real-time Status Updates:** The API will not provide a separate endpoint to check the status of a background email job. Status will be available via logs.
