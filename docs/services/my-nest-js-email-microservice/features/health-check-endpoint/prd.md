# Technical Enabler PRD: Health Check Endpoint

## 1. Enabler Name

Health Check Endpoint

## 2. Epic

- **Epic PRD:** [../../epic.md](./../epic.md)
- **Epic Architecture:** [../../arch.md](./../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** To ensure the email microservice is observable and can be effectively managed by container orchestration systems (like Kubernetes) and monitoring tools, it needs a standardized way to report its health status.
- **Solution:** This enabler will introduce a dedicated, unauthenticated `GET /health` endpoint. This endpoint will provide a simple, quick-to-respond status check, indicating whether the service is running and ready to accept traffic.
- **Impact:** Enables automated health monitoring, which is critical for reliability and high availability. It allows orchestration systems to automatically restart unhealthy service instances and prevent traffic from being routed to pods that are not ready.

## 4. User Personas

- **Primary User (Programmatic):** Container Orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), Load Balancers, and Monitoring Systems (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog).
- **Secondary User (Human):** DevOps Engineers and Platform Developers who need to manually check the status of the service during deployment or debugging.

## 5. User Stories

- As a container orchestrator, I want to poll a `/health` endpoint to determine if the service is alive so that I can restart it if it becomes unresponsive (liveness probe).
- As a load balancer, I want to poll a `/health` endpoint to determine if the service is ready to accept traffic so that I can safely add it to the pool of available servers (readiness probe).
- As a developer, I want to be able to hit the `/health` endpoint with my browser or cURL to quickly verify that the service is running after a deployment.

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- The service MUST expose a `GET /health` endpoint.
- This endpoint MUST NOT require any authentication.
- A successful response MUST return a `200 OK` status code.
- The response body SHOULD be a JSON object indicating the status, e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`.
- The health check logic SHOULD be lightweight and not involve heavy computations or database calls.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The endpoint must respond in under 50ms.
- **Availability:** The endpoint must be available as soon as the HTTP server starts.
- **Simplicity:** The check should be simple and avoid complex dependencies to ensure its own reliability.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Service is Healthy

- **Given** the email microservice is running correctly.
- **When** a GET request is made to the `/health` endpoint.
- **Then** the API should respond with a `200 OK` status code.
- **And** the response body should be `{"status": "ok"}`.

### Scenario 2: Service is Unhealthy (e.g., event loop blocked)

- **Given** the email microservice is running but is in a hung or unresponsive state.
- **When** a GET request is made to the `/health` endpoint.
- **Then** the request should time out (as determined by the client/orchestrator).

## 8. Out of Scope

- **Deep Dependency Checks:** This basic health check will not verify the status of downstream dependencies like the SMTP provider or a database. A more comprehensive status endpoint could be added later if needed.
- **Authentication/Authorization:** This endpoint is explicitly public.
- **Detailed Diagnostics:** The endpoint will not provide detailed diagnostic information, memory usage, or other metrics. That is the responsibility of a dedicated metrics/telemetry solution.
