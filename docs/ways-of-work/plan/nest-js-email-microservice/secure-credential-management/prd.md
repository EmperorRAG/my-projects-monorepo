# Technical Enabler PRD: Secure Credential Management

## 1. Enabler Name

Secure Credential Management

## 2. Epic

- **Epic PRD:** [../../epic.md](./../epic.md)
- **Epic Architecture:** [../../arch.md](./../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** The email microservice requires sensitive credentials (e.g., SMTP username and password) to function. Storing these credentials directly in configuration files or source code is a major security risk.
- **Solution:** This enabler will implement a secure mechanism for managing and accessing SMTP credentials. The Nest.js `ConfigModule` will be used to load credentials from environment variables, which will be securely injected into the environment at runtime.
- **Impact:** Decouples sensitive credentials from the application codebase, significantly improving the security posture of the service. It aligns with best practices for managing secrets in a cloud-native environment.

## 4. User Personas

- **Primary User (Human):** DevOps Engineers who are responsible for injecting secrets into the production environment.
- **Secondary User (Programmatic):** The `SmtpModule`, which needs to consume these credentials to configure the Nodemailer transport.

## 5. User Stories

- As a DevOps Engineer, I want to provide SMTP credentials to the application through environment variables so that they are not exposed in the source code.
- As a Platform Developer, I want the application to fail fast on startup if the required SMTP credentials are not available in the environment.
- As a Platform Developer, I want to access credentials through a standardized configuration service so that the logic for reading environment variables is centralized.

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- The Nest.js `ConfigModule` (`@nestjs/config`) MUST be added as a dependency and configured for the application.
- The `SmtpModule` MUST use the `ConfigService` to retrieve the SMTP host, port, username, and password.
- The application MUST perform validation to ensure that all required SMTP-related environment variables are present during startup.
- If any required credential is missing, the application MUST log a fatal error and exit.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Credentials must not be logged or otherwise exposed in an unsecured manner.
- **Configuration:** The approach should be flexible enough to support different environments (development, staging, production) with different credential sets.
- **Maintainability:** The code for accessing configuration should be clean, centralized, and easy to understand.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: All Credentials Present

- **Given** all required SMTP environment variables (e.g., `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`) are set.
- **When** the application starts.
- **Then** the `ConfigModule` should load the variables successfully.
- **And** the `SmtpModule` should be initialized with the correct credentials.
- **And** the application should start without errors.

### Scenario 2: Missing Credentials

- **Given** one or more required SMTP environment variables are missing.
- **When** the application starts.
- **Then** the application should log a descriptive error message indicating which variables are missing.
- **And** the application process should terminate and not attempt to start the web server.

### Scenario 3: Credentials in Use

- **Given** the application is running and has loaded credentials.
- **When** the `SmtpService` is used to send an email.
- **Then** the Nodemailer transport should be configured with the credentials loaded by the `ConfigService`.

## 8. Out of Scope

- **Secrets Storage Mechanism:** The choice of how secrets are stored at the infrastructure level (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets) is out of scope. This enabler is only concerned with how the application *consumes* secrets from its environment.
- **Dynamic Secret Rotation:** The ability to handle rotated secrets without an application restart is out of scope for this initial implementation.
