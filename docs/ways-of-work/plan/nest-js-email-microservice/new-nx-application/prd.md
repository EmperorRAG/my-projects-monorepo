# Technical Enabler PRD: New Nx Application

## 1. Enabler Name

New Nx Application

## 2. Epic

- **Epic PRD:** [../../epic.md](./../epic.md)
- **Epic Architecture:** [../../arch.md](./../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** The new Nest.js Email Microservice needs a dedicated, isolated, and well-structured home within the Nx monorepo. Without a proper application setup, it's difficult to manage dependencies, run tests, build, and deploy the service independently.
- **Solution:** This enabler involves generating a new Nest.js application within the Nx workspace. This provides a standardized structure, build/test configurations, and integration with the monorepo's tooling.
- **Impact:** Establishes a clean, maintainable, and scalable foundation for the microservice. It enables developers to leverage Nx's capabilities for code generation, dependency management, and task execution, leading to a more efficient development workflow.

## 4. User Personas

- **Primary User (Human):** Platform Developers who will be building and maintaining the email microservice.
- **Secondary User (Programmatic):** The Nx build and CI/CD systems that will test, build, and deploy the application.

## 5. User Stories

- As a Platform Developer, I want a dedicated Nx application for the email service so that I can manage its source code and dependencies in isolation from other applications in the monorepo.
- As a Platform Developer, I want to be able to run tests, lint, and build the email service using standard Nx commands (`nx test`, `nx lint`, `nx build`).
- As a DevOps Engineer, I want the new application to have a standardized project structure so that our CI/CD pipelines can easily locate artifacts and run deployment scripts.

## 6. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- A new Nest.js application MUST be generated within the `apps` directory of the Nx monorepo.
- The application MUST be named `email-service` (or a similar descriptive name).
- The application MUST be configured with its own `project.json` (or equivalent `package.json` configuration) file, defining targets for `build`, `serve`, `test`, and `lint`.
- The application MUST include a default `main.ts`, `app.module.ts`, `app.controller.ts`, and `app.service.ts`.
- The application MUST be runnable in a development environment using `nx serve email-service`.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Maintainability:** The application structure should follow Nx and Nest.js best practices to ensure it is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Scalability:** The setup should not hinder the ability to add new modules, controllers, or services as the application grows.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Application Generation

- **Given** a developer is in the root of the Nx monorepo.
- **When** the developer runs the appropriate Nx generator command for a new Nest.js application.
- **Then** a new directory `apps/email-service` is created.
- **And** the new application can be successfully built using `nx build email-service`.
- **And** the new application's tests can be run successfully using `nx test email-service`.

### Scenario 2: Default Endpoint

- **Given** the new application is running via `nx serve email-service`.
- **When** a GET request is made to the root endpoint (`/`).
- **Then** the application should respond with the default "Welcome to email-service!" message generated by Nest.js.

## 8. Out of Scope

- **Domain Logic:** The implementation of any email-specific logic is out of scope for this enabler.
- **Dockerization:** Creating a Dockerfile for the new application is a separate concern (covered by the "Base Docker Image" enabler).
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configuring the CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy this specific application is out of scope.
