# Feature PRD — Nx Health Check Task

## 1. Feature Name

Nx Health Check Task

## 2. Epic

- [Unified Health Monitoring for NGINX Edge Services — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Unified Health Monitoring — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Manual `curl` scripts are used to verify health endpoints during CI, leading to inconsistent checks and brittle pipelines.
- **Solution:** Provide an Nx target that triggers scripted health checks against gateway and load balancer endpoints with standardized reporting.
- **Impact:** Enables automated and repeatable health verification across environments, improving deployment confidence and reducing manual effort.

## 4. User Personas

- DevOps Engineer — Runs the task during CI/CD to gate releases.
- Platform Engineer — Maintains the scripts and ensures they align with infrastructure changes.
- QA Engineer — Validates staging environments using the same task to keep parity with production.

## 5. User Stories

- As a DevOps engineer, I want an Nx command that verifies all health endpoints so that pipelines can fail fast if services are unhealthy.
- As a platform engineer, I want configurable endpoint lists so that new services can be added without rewriting scripts.
- As a QA engineer, I want readable reports so that I can diagnose failures quickly.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Implement an Nx target `nginx-health:check` that invokes a Node/TS script performing HTTP requests against configured endpoints.
  - Support configuration through `project.json` to specify endpoints, expected status codes, and timeout thresholds.
  - Output structured logs (JSON or table) summarizing results and return non-zero exit codes for failures.
  - Provide options to skip environments or endpoints via command-line flags or environment variables.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Task execution should complete within one minute for default endpoint sets.
  - Script must be compatible with Windows and Linux CI runners.
  - Maintain test coverage for the script’s core logic (e.g., request handling, error paths).
  - Ensure documentation explains usage, configuration, and integration patterns.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `npx nx health-check nginx` (or documented alias) executes requests and reports success/failure per endpoint.
- [ ] Pipeline demonstration shows the task failing when an endpoint returns a non-200 response with appropriate logs.
- [ ] Test suite covers success, timeout, and failure scenarios for the health check script.
- [ ] Documentation in the repo details configuration, overrides, and examples for local and CI usage.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Building dashboards or visualization tooling for health results.
- Integrating with external monitoring systems (handled by separate initiatives).
- Automatic retries or circuit-breaker behavior beyond simple retries configured in scripts.
