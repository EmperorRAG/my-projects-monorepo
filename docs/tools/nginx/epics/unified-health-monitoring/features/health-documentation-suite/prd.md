# Feature PRD — Health Documentation Suite

## 1. Feature Name

Health Documentation Suite

## 2. Epic

- [Unified Health Monitoring for NGINX Edge Services — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Unified Health Monitoring — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** There is no centralized reference explaining how health endpoints, scripts, and Docker healthchecks interrelate, causing inconsistent onboarding and operational gaps.
- **Solution:** Produce documentation that aggregates procedures, diagrams, troubleshooting guides, and FAQ entries for the unified health monitoring stack.
- **Impact:** Teams ramp up faster, reduce misconfigurations, and share a single source of truth for health-related workflows.

## 4. User Personas

- Site Reliability Engineer — Needs operational runbooks and troubleshooting steps.
- Platform Engineer — Requires detailed configuration guidance to keep infrastructure consistent.
- Technical Writer / Support Engineer — Documents updates and communicates changes to stakeholders.

## 5. User Stories

- As an SRE, I want a runbook explaining how to validate health endpoints so that outages can be resolved faster.
- As a platform engineer, I want diagrams that show how health requests traverse the system so that I can debug networking issues.
- As a support engineer, I want FAQs that cover common failure scenarios so that I can assist teams without escalating immediately.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Create a dedicated documentation folder describing health endpoint architecture, Docker healthchecks, and Nx tasks.
  - Include procedural runbooks for verifying health, responding to failures, and updating configurations.
  - Provide diagrams (Mermaid or image references) illustrating request flows and component relationships.
  - Maintain changelog entries capturing updates to health monitoring tooling.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Documentation must follow repo standards (Markdown formatting, lint compliance, accessibility guidelines).
  - Content should be discoverable via navigation from the main NGINX docs index.
  - Versioning guidance must explain how to update documentation alongside code changes.
  - Runbooks should be concise, action-oriented, and validated through dry runs.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation folder exists with architecture overview, runbooks, FAQ, and troubleshooting sections.
- [ ] Runbooks are tested through tabletop exercises or peer review, with notes recorded.
- [ ] Diagrams render successfully and align with the architecture defined in the Epic.
- [ ] Documentation references Nx tasks, Docker healthchecks, and gateway endpoints cohesively.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Creating automated documentation generators or dashboards.
- Translating documentation into multiple languages.
- Advanced training materials (videos, workshops) beyond written guides.
