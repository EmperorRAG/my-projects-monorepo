# Feature PRD — Observability Extensibility

## 1. Feature Name

Observability Extensibility

## 2. Epic

- [Unified Health Monitoring for NGINX Edge Services — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Unified Health Monitoring — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Health monitoring data is siloed, with no standardized mechanism for exporting metrics to existing observability platforms.
- **Solution:** Define extension points and adapters that stream healthcheck results, logs, and status changes to systems like Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Impact:** Enables centralized dashboards, alerts, and trend analysis across the edge platform, improving visibility and proactive maintenance.

## 4. User Personas

- Observability Engineer — Integrates health data into dashboards and alerting pipelines.
- Site Reliability Engineer — Uses exported metrics to detect anomalies and respond quickly.
- Platform Engineer — Ensures adapters remain maintainable and secure.

## 5. User Stories

- As an observability engineer, I want structured metrics from gateway and load balancer healthchecks so that I can chart service availability over time.
- As an SRE, I want webhook hooks or message streams when health status changes so that I can trigger automated responses.
- As a platform engineer, I want clear extension patterns so that new observability tools can be connected without rewriting the core.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Provide a standard interface (e.g., event emitter or message schema) for healthcheck results.
  - Implement at least one adapter that publishes metrics to Prometheus or emits structured logs compatible with the existing stack.
  - Allow configuration of export frequency, endpoints, and credentials through environment variables or config files.
  - Ensure adapters gracefully handle network failures and queue retries where appropriate.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Export mechanisms must not add more than 5% overhead to healthcheck execution time.
  - Security controls must protect credentials and ensure sensitive data is not exposed.
  - Solution must be extensible—document how to add new adapters with minimal code changes.
  - Tests must validate adapter behavior under success, failure, and retry conditions.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Healthcheck framework emits structured events consumed by at least one adapter (e.g., Prometheus exporter, log sink).
- [ ] Configuration examples demonstrate enabling/disabling adapters per environment.
- [ ] Observability dashboards or sample queries illustrate data sourced from the adapters.
- [ ] Documentation explains extension points, security considerations, and adapter development guidelines.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Building full production dashboards (only examples and integration guidance are required).
- Creating adapters for every observability platform (focus on core stack with extension pattern for others).
- Long-term storage or analytics pipelines beyond data export interfaces.
