# Feature PRD — Docker Healthcheck Integration

## 1. Feature Name

Docker Healthcheck Integration

## 2. Epic

- [Unified Health Monitoring for NGINX Edge Services — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Unified Health Monitoring — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Containerized NGINX services lack standardized Docker `HEALTHCHECK` instructions, preventing orchestrators from detecting unhealthy replicas.
- **Solution:** Embed Docker healthcheck commands in each service image that reuse the unified health endpoints and scripts.
- **Impact:** Orchestrators can automatically restart unhealthy containers, improving resiliency and lowering mean time to recovery.

## 4. User Personas

- Site Reliability Engineer — Relies on orchestrators (Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes) to cycle unhealthy pods automatically.
- DevOps Engineer — Maintains Dockerfiles and ensures health commands stay aligned with monitoring endpoints.
- Release Engineer — Uses healthcheck feedback during deployment rollouts to catch issues early.

## 5. User Stories

- As an SRE, I want Docker healthchecks to call the same endpoints as manual checks so that container orchestrators behave consistently with human workflows.
- As a DevOps engineer, I want reusable healthcheck scripts so that every service can adopt them without duplication.
- As a release engineer, I want failing healthchecks to block promotions so that broken images never reach production.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Add `HEALTHCHECK` instructions to relevant Dockerfiles (gateway, load balancers) that invoke a shared health script or curl command.
  - Healthcheck must support configurable timeouts and intervals via build-time or runtime arguments.
  - Provide a shared shell/Node script that exits non-zero when health endpoints fail.
  - Update Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests to respect the new healthchecks.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Healthcheck commands must complete within five seconds to avoid resource contention.
  - Scripts must run on Alpine-based and Debian-based images used in the repo.
  - Documentation must describe how to override healthcheck intervals in different environments.
  - Ensure downstream pipelines (CI, local dev) still pass with the healthchecks enabled.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Docker images for gateway and load balancers include `HEALTHCHECK` instructions that execute successfully when services are healthy.
- [ ] Failing healthchecks trigger container restarts in Docker Compose during testing.
- [ ] Documentation covers configuration, runtime overrides, and troubleshooting guidance.
- [ ] CI pipelines build images and confirm healthcheck execution without regressions.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Creating new container images beyond existing NGINX-related services.
- Orchestrator-specific auto-scaling or advanced restart policies.
- Integration with non-Docker environments (e.g., bare metal systemd services).
