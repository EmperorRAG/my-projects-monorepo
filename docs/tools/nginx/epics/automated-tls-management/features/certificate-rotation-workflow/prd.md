# Feature PRD — Certificate Rotation Workflow

## 1. Feature Name

Certificate Rotation Workflow

## 2. Epic

- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Manual certificate rotation risks downtime and human error, often leading to expired or mis-deployed certificates when renewals happen under pressure.
- **Solution:** Provide an automated workflow that backs up existing certificates, installs new material, reloads NGINX without dropping connections, and exposes toggles for backup retention and dry runs.
- **Impact:** Operations teams can rotate certificates proactively with predictable, auditable steps, significantly reducing the chance of outages or misconfigurations during renewals.

## 4. User Personas

- Site Reliability Engineer — Orchestrates production rotations and ensures zero-downtime delivery.
- Platform Engineer — Maintains the automation scripts and integrates them with Nx targets.
- Compliance Auditor — Reviews rotation logs to confirm adherence to security policy.

## 5. User Stories

- As an SRE, I want a one-command rotation process that performs backups and reloads NGINX safely so that I can renew certificates without service degradation.
- As a platform engineer, I want configurable retention for rotated certificates so that I can preserve rollback options while complying with storage policies.
- As an auditor, I want rotation runs to emit structured logs describing actions taken so that I can verify the controls during compliance reviews.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Deliver a rotation script (`rotate-certs.sh`) that copies current certificates to a timestamped backup, installs new files, and triggers an NGINX reload.
  - Support feature flags for backup retention count, reload toggle, and dry-run verification.
  - Integrate with an Nx target (`tls:rotate-certs`) that surfaces configuration options and renders human-readable status updates.
  - Emit structured logs summarizing start time, actions, success/failure, and backup locations.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Reload operations must maintain active connections (graceful reload) without dropping requests.
  - Rotation steps must complete within 30 seconds under normal workloads.
  - Scripts must run on Linux/macOS hosts and within containerized environments.
  - Backups must inherit secure permissions and be pruned automatically based on retention settings.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `nx run tls:rotate-certs -- --dry-run` reports the planned actions without modifying files.
- [ ] Executing the rotation with new certificate assets completes successfully, retains backups, and reloads NGINX without downtime.
- [ ] Log output records backup paths, reload status, and any warnings for audit purposes.
- [ ] Retention settings purge backups beyond the configured count while preserving the most recent artifacts.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Automated scheduling of rotations (handled by separate operational tooling).
- Integration with external secret stores for fetching new certificates.
- Multi-node distributed rotation coordination beyond documentation guidance.
