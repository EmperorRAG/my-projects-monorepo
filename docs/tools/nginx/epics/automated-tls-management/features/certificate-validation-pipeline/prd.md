# Feature PRD — Certificate Validation Pipeline

## 1. Feature Name

Certificate Validation Pipeline

## 2. Epic

- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Teams lack a reliable way to verify certificate integrity, leading to broken key pairs, weak cipher selections, and undetected expiration windows that threaten availability.
- **Solution:** Deliver a validation pipeline that inspects certificates and keys for alignment, ownership, file permissions, expiry, and SAN coverage, returning actionable guidance via Nx commands and CI-friendly exits.
- **Impact:** The platform identifies TLS risks before deployment, shortens incident response, and provides audit artifacts proving adherence to security policies.

## 4. User Personas

- Site Reliability Engineer — Ensures certificates supplied to production meet compliance and reliability standards.
- Platform Engineer — Executes validation prior to distributing certificates or merging automation changes.
- Compliance Auditor — Consumes the validation report as evidence of TLS governance.

## 5. User Stories

- As an SRE, I want an Nx validation task that fails when certificates and keys do not match so that production rollouts stop before causing outages.
- As a platform engineer, I want warnings for certificates expiring within a configurable threshold so that I can trigger renewals early.
- As an auditor, I want a machine-readable report capturing validation results so that compliance reviews have verifiable evidence.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Create a validation script (for example, `validate-certs.sh`) that checks key-to-certificate matching, SAN coverage, expiration windows, and file permissions.
  - Integrate the script into an Nx target (`tls:validate-certs`) with CLI flags for warning thresholds, output modes (text/JSON), and certificate directories.
  - Return non-zero exit codes when validations fail and structured warnings when approaching expiration.
  - Provide optional integration with CI/CD pipelines via generated artifacts stored under `tools/nginx/scripts/tls/reports/`.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Validation runs must complete within 10 seconds for up to 10 certificate pairs.
  - Script must be idempotent and safe to run repeatedly without modifying certificates.
  - Output formats must be consistent and documented for tooling consumption.
  - Solution must operate on macOS, Linux, and containerized environments without additional dependencies beyond OpenSSL and POSIX tools.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `nx run tls:validate-certs` against development assets reports matching key pairs, secure permissions, and expiry windows.
- [ ] Providing an invalid key pair causes the command to exit with status code `1` and clearly identify the mismatch.
- [ ] Configurable warning thresholds (for example, 30 days) surface as highlighted warnings without failing the command.
- [ ] JSON output mode is consumable by CI pipelines and stored as an artifact when invoked in automation.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Automatic renewal or rotation triggers (handled by the rotation workflow).
- Integration with external certificate inventory systems or CMDBs.
- Validation of certificate chains beyond the immediate key pair and SAN entries.
