# Feature PRD — TLS Compose Overlay and Hardened Snippets

## 1. Feature Name

TLS Compose Overlay and Hardened Snippets

## 2. Epic

- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Without a standard TLS overlay and NGINX snippets, teams duplicate configuration, miss critical security headers, and risk inconsistent cipher settings across environments.
- **Solution:** Deliver composable NGINX snippets and Docker Compose overlays that enforce modern TLS protocols, security headers, OCSP stapling, and secure volume mounts for certificates.
- **Impact:** All edge deployments inherit battle-tested TLS defaults, reducing audit findings and ensuring production readiness with minimal manual configuration.

## 4. User Personas

- Platform Engineer — Curates the overlay and snippets for reuse across projects.
- Site Reliability Engineer — Reviews security posture and validates compatibility with production traffic.
- Application Engineer — Applies the overlay to gain HTTPS support without deep NGINX expertise.

## 5. User Stories

- As a platform engineer, I want reusable snippets for headers, logging, and TLS options so that I can apply consistent security posture across services.
- As an SRE, I want the TLS overlay to mount certificate volumes securely and configure OCSP stapling so that compliance criteria are met by default.
- As an application engineer, I want a documented Compose overlay that I can enable with one command so that HTTPS works in development and staging.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Provide hardened NGINX snippets covering TLS protocols, cipher suites, HSTS, OCSP stapling, and security headers.
  - Create Docker Compose overlays that mount certificate directories read-only, expose HTTPS ports, and configure health checks.
  - Document how to enable the overlay via Compose and Nx targets, including environment variable requirements.
  - Ensure snippets are referenced across edge components (proxy, load balancers) with consistent include patterns.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Default TLS configuration must achieve an "A" grade on SSL Labs or equivalent benchmark.
  - Overlays must be idempotent and compatible with both development and production docker-compose files.
  - Snippets and overlays must be linted and validated through automated tests or `nginx -t` checks.
  - Documentation must highlight any runtime dependencies (for example, stapling cache) and fallback behavior.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enabling the TLS overlay results in edge containers serving HTTPS with modern protocols and security headers.
- [ ] Automated validation (for example, `nx run tls:test-https`) confirms the overlay passes `nginx -t` and health checks.
- [ ] SSL Labs or equivalent scan of the default configuration scores at least an "A" rating.
- [ ] Documentation details activation steps, environment variables, and troubleshooting guidance.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Full automation of certificate issuance (handled by Let’s Encrypt automation).
- Integration with hardware security modules or cloud-specific key stores.
- Custom per-application TLS policies beyond documented overrides.
