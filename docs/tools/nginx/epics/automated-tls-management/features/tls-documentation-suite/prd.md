# Feature PRD — TLS Documentation Suite

## 1. Feature Name

TLS Documentation Suite

## 2. Epic

- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Without centralized documentation, engineers struggle to understand TLS workflows, leading to inconsistent adoption and operational mistakes.
- **Solution:** Produce a cohesive set of guides, runbooks, quick starts, and troubleshooting references that explain certificate generation, validation, rotation, and Let’s Encrypt workflows end-to-end.
- **Impact:** Teams ramp faster, audits pass with clear evidence, and operational incidents decrease because engineers follow tested procedures.

## 4. User Personas

- Platform Engineer — Authors and maintains the documentation while onboarding new contributors.
- Site Reliability Engineer — Uses runbooks and workflows during production operations and audits.
- Application Engineer — References quickstarts to enable HTTPS in application stacks.

## 5. User Stories

- As a platform engineer, I want a quickstart that walks through development certificate generation so that I can onboard teammates efficiently.
- As an SRE, I want a rotation runbook with decision trees and rollback steps so that I can handle incidents confidently.
- As an application engineer, I want a troubleshooting guide covering common TLS errors so that I can self-serve fixes without escalating.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Create documentation artifacts covering setup, quickstart, runbook, troubleshooting, and compliance checklist.
  - Link each guide to the relevant automation scripts and Nx targets.
  - Provide diagrams illustrating certificate flow, rotation lifecycle, and Let’s Encrypt integrations.
  - Include FAQs and best practices addressing trust store management, renewal cadence, and security considerations.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Documentation must follow repository style guides (Markdown structure, navigation, and linking conventions).
  - Content should be accessible (clear headings, tables, and callouts) and searchable via repo tooling.
  - Updates must be version-controlled with changelog entries in the documentation directory.
  - Examples must be validated for accuracy during QA reviews before publication.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each major TLS workflow (generate, validate, rotate, enroll, troubleshoot) has an associated guide linked from the tool README.
- [ ] Runbooks include step-by-step procedures with verification points and rollback instructions.
- [ ] Diagrams render successfully and reflect the current automation architecture.
- [ ] Documentation cross-links to scripts and Nx targets, enabling engineers to execute tasks directly from the guides.

## 8. Out of Scope

- External public documentation or marketing collateral (internal engineering focus only).
- Translation/localization of content into additional languages.
- Automation for reviewing or approving documentation updates (manual review remains in place).
