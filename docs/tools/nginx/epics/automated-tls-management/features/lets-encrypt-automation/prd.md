# Feature PRD — Let’s Encrypt Automation

## 1. Feature Name

Let’s Encrypt Automation

## 2. Epic

- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Setting up Let’s Encrypt requires manual package installation, challenge configuration, and renewal scheduling that differ across environments and operating systems.
- **Solution:** Provide cross-platform scripts and Nx commands that install certbot, configure challenge handling, enroll domains, and register automated renewals with post-renewal hooks.
- **Impact:** Production teams can enable trusted certificates quickly, avoid misconfiguration, and ensure continuous renewals without human intervention.

## 4. User Personas

- Site Reliability Engineer — Leads production certificate provisioning and renewal scheduling.
- Platform Engineer — Maintains the automation and adapts scripts for new environments.
- Compliance Auditor — Confirms that production certificates are issued and renewed by an approved CA with proper logging.

## 5. User Stories

- As an SRE, I want an Nx command that installs certbot with required dependencies so that I can enroll domains consistently across hosts.
- As a platform engineer, I want the automation to support both HTTP and DNS challenge flows so that I can accommodate different infrastructure constraints.
- As an auditor, I want renewal runs to emit logs and notifications so that we can demonstrate continuous compliance.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Deliver an installation script (`setup-letsencrypt.sh`) that detects OS, installs certbot, and configures required plugins.
  - Provide scripts to request initial certificates, configure ACME challenges (HTTP-01 via NGINX snippets, optional DNS hooks), and schedule renewals via cron or systemd timers.
  - Integrate automation with an Nx target (`tls:setup-letsencrypt`) exposing domain, email, and challenge options.
  - Configure renewal hooks that reload NGINX and notify operators on success or failure.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Support Ubuntu/Debian, AlmaLinux/RHEL, and macOS development environments at minimum.
  - Scripts must log actions and exit non-zero on failure to facilitate monitoring.
  - Renewal operations must complete before certificate expiry with at least a seven-day safety margin.
  - Documentation must call out rate limits and domain ownership verification steps.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `nx run tls:setup-letsencrypt -- --domain example.com` installs certbot, provisions a certificate, and stores assets in the configured secrets location.
- [ ] Renewal jobs execute successfully and trigger NGINX reloads without manual intervention.
- [ ] Operators receive log messages or notifications upon renewals and on failure conditions.
- [ ] Documentation covers prerequisites, DNS settings, and rollback steps, and is referenced by the automation output.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Automated DNS provider integrations beyond documented examples (manual token entry remains acceptable).
- Wildcard certificate provisioning (captured as future roadmap work).
- Integration with third-party monitoring or alerting platforms for renewal status.
