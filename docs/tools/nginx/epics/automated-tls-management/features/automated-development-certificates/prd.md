# Feature PRD — Automated Development Certificate Generation

## 1. Feature Name

Automated Development Certificate Generation

## 2. Epic

- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [Automated TLS and Certificate Management — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Platform engineers currently handcraft self-signed certificates or reuse stale keys when configuring HTTPS locally. This creates mismatched SAN coverage, trust warnings in browsers, and inconsistent developer experiences across services.
- **Solution:** Provide a scripted workflow that generates development certificates with the correct SAN entries, secure defaults, and automated trust bootstrapping. The process is surfaced through dedicated Nx targets so every environment can be provisioned with a single command.
- **Impact:** Engineers can enable HTTPS locally in under a minute, reduce onboarding friction, and eliminate defects caused by misconfigured certificates. Consistent automation also aligns development environments with production security expectations.

## 4. User Personas

- Platform Engineer — Primary owner of the automation, responsible for generating and distributing development certificates.
- Site Reliability Engineer — Reviews the scripts for security posture and ensures parity with production practices.
- Application Engineer — Consumes the automation to run apps over HTTPS without deep TLS knowledge.

## 5. User Stories

- As a platform engineer, I want to run an Nx command that generates trusted development certificates so that I can enable HTTPS locally without manual OpenSSL steps.
- As an application engineer, I want the generated certificates to include localhost and loopback SAN entries so that my browser trusts every service endpoint.
- As an SRE, I want the automation to document the certificate locations and permissions so that compliance checks verify secure handling of private keys.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Provide a Bash script that issues self-signed certificates with SAN coverage for localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, and configurable dev domains.
  - Expose the script via an Nx target (for example, `tls:generate-dev-certs`) with options for output directory, validity window, and key size.
  - Generate trust store installation instructions for macOS, Windows, and Linux to streamline developer setup.
  - Output human-readable summaries including certificate fingerprints, expiry dates, and SAN values.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Minimum RSA 4096-bit or EC P-256 key strength, with configurable algorithm defaults.
  - Shell tooling must pass `shellcheck` and follow internal scripting standards.
  - Execution time should be under 15 seconds on a typical developer laptop.
  - Generated files must use restrictive permissions (600 for keys, 644 for certificates) and avoid committing secrets to source control.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `nx run tls:generate-dev-certs` creates certificate/key pairs with the expected SAN entries and secure permissions.
- [ ] The command prints a summary that includes expiry, fingerprint, and trust-store installation instructions.
- [ ] Trusting the generated root certificate on macOS, Windows, and Linux eliminates browser HTTPS warnings for local services.
- [ ] Scripts pass automated linting and execute successfully on CI runners that validate development tooling.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Automating trust store import across every operating system (documented but not scripted).
- Generating production certificates or managing domains beyond development use cases.
- Integrating with enterprise secret management solutions for development assets.
