# Epic Name

Automated TLS and Certificate Management for NGINX

## Goal

### Problem

Before automation, enabling HTTPS across the edge platform required manual certificate generation, ad-hoc key rotation, and inconsistent security posture. Teams risked expired certificates, insecure cipher configurations, and production downtime during certificate renewals. Lack of standardized tooling also slowed onboarding for new environments and made compliance audits difficult.

### Solution

Introduce a fully automated TLS toolchain that covers certificate generation, validation, rotation, and Let’s Encrypt enrollment. Provide hardened NGINX TLS configuration snippets, Docker Compose overlays, and Nx tasks so engineers can enable HTTPS in both development and production with minimal effort. Comprehensive documentation and runbooks guide certificate management, renewal workflows, and troubleshooting.

### Impact

The epic standardizes HTTPS enablement, reduces operational risk, and ensures the platform meets modern security benchmarks. Automated workflows prevent outages caused by expired certificates, while consistent TLS settings protect customer data, maintain trust, and satisfy compliance requirements. Teams can ship features faster because TLS is no longer a bespoke, error-prone process.

## User Personas

- **Platform Engineer (Primary)** – Owns TLS automation scripts, integrates with Nx, and ensures the edge stack always ships with secure defaults.
- **Site Reliability Engineer (Stakeholder)** – Monitors certificate health, manages rotations, and audits TLS settings for compliance.
- **Application Team Engineer (Secondary)** – Consumes the automation to enable HTTPS locally or in production without deep TLS expertise.

## High-Level User Journeys

1. **Development HTTPS Setup** – A platform engineer runs the Nx target to generate self-signed certificates, enables the TLS Docker Compose overlay, and validates HTTPS locally.
2. **Production Certificate Issuance** – An SRE runs the Let’s Encrypt setup script, enrolls a domain, and configures automatic renewals with post-renewal NGINX reload hooks.
3. **Ongoing Maintenance** – A platform engineer validates certificates, rotates them before expiry, and references the runbook for emergency recovery or audit evidence.

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Provide Bash scripts for generating development certificates with SANs covering localhost, dev domains, and loopback IPs.
- Deliver validation tooling that checks certificate/key alignment, permissions, key strength, and expiration dates.
- Automate rotation with backup retention, zero-downtime reloads, and configurable toggles for backup or reload behavior.
- Offer Let’s Encrypt integration including automated certbot installation, challenge handling, renewal scheduling, and NGINX reload hooks.
- Supply TLS-specific NGINX snippets with modern cipher suites, protocol restrictions, OCSP stapling, and security headers.
- Create Docker Compose overlays for TLS-enabled deployments, health checks, and secure volume mounts.
- Add Nx targets covering certificate generation, validation, rotation, Let’s Encrypt setup, and HTTPS smoke testing.
- Document end-to-end TLS workflows in setup guides, README sections, runbooks, and quickstarts.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security** – Enforce TLS 1.2+/1.3 only, strong forward-secret cipher suites, HSTS, and secure file permissions for private keys.
- **Reliability** – Ensure certificate automation prevents downtime by supporting pre-emptive validation and automated reloads.
- **Compliance** – Provide audit-ready documentation and logging that demonstrate adherence to industry TLS best practices.
- **Usability** – Offer clear commands, documentation, and guardrails so engineers with limited TLS knowledge can follow workflows.
- **Maintainability** – Keep scripts modular, shellcheck-compliant, and well-commented for future updates.

## Success Metrics

- **Deployment Coverage** – 100% of edge deployments use the standardized TLS configuration and automation scripts.
- **Certificate Health** – No unplanned downtime from expired or misconfigured certificates during observation period.
- **Operational Time Savings** – Reduce manual time to enable HTTPS from multiple hours to under 30 minutes for new environments.
- **Security Posture** – External scans (e.g., SSL Labs) achieve at least an A rating using default configuration.

## Out of Scope

- Organization-wide secret management vault integrations (future work).
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) between edge and upstream services (captured as advanced follow-up).
- Automated DNS challenge orchestration beyond documented scripts (manual configuration remains acceptable).

## Business Value

**High** – Automated TLS dramatically reduces security risk and operational toil while ensuring customer trust. It unlocks faster production launches, keeps compliance auditors satisfied, and prevents revenue-impacting outages from expired certificates. The epic pays ongoing dividends by standardizing critical security posture across environments.
