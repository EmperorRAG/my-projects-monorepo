# Epic Name

NGINX Edge Traffic Platform

## Goal

### Problem

The monorepo lacked a hardened, multi-tier ingress layer capable of securely routing web, API, and email traffic across the portfolio. Without a unified edge proxy and dedicated load balancers, deployments were brittle, TLS termination was inconsistent, and each team was hand-rolling networking logic directly in their services. Operational teams could not enforce security headers, rate limits, or connection policies at a single control point, making it difficult to scale and exposing the platform to availability and compliance risks.

### Solution

Build a production-grade NGINX edge platform composed of a gateway proxy and service-specific load balancers. The solution centralizes TLS termination, host-based routing, caching, and rate limiting, while providing Docker- and Nx-managed workflows so platform engineers can stand up, validate, and iterate on the networking stack quickly. Shared configuration snippets, environment overlays, and dedicated Docker images keep the system modular yet consistent across environments.

### Impact

The epic unlocks reliable traffic management, consistent security enforcement, and faster onboarding of new services. A shared edge layer reduces duplicate effort, improves latency through optimized caching and compression, and lets operations teams roll out networking changes without touching each application. Ultimately, the business gains higher uptime, a stronger security posture, and the ability to launch new services behind the edge with minimal lead time.

## User Personas

- **Platform Engineer (Primary)** – Designs and maintains the shared edge stack, integrates Nx targets, and ensures the infrastructure is repeatable across environments.
- **Site Reliability Engineer (Stakeholder)** – Monitors availability, enforces rate limiting, and manages incident response using the edge-level controls.
- **Application Team Engineer (Secondary)** – Consumes the load balancer layer to expose new apps or microservices without learning NGINX internals.

## High-Level User Journeys

1. **Provision Edge Stack** – A platform engineer runs Nx tasks to build images, start the edge proxy plus load balancers, and verify connectivity using the included validation script.
2. **Onboard New Service** – An application engineer adds an upstream configuration or overlay, validates locally, and submits a change knowing the edge provides caching, compression, and health checks by default.
3. **Operations & Incident Response** – An SRE inspects logs, adjusts rate-limiting thresholds, or reloads configuration through Nx commands to mitigate traffic spikes without downtime.

## Business Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Provide an edge proxy capable of host-based routing, TLS termination, and security header management.
- Deliver dedicated load balancers for frontend, API, and email workloads with role-appropriate caching, rate limiting, and upstream configuration.
- Supply shared configuration snippets (headers, logging, base) and environment overlays (development, production) to keep infrastructure consistent and auditable.
- Offer validated Docker Compose definitions for development and production that create necessary networks, health checks, and resource limits.
- Integrate the platform with Nx so teams can build, serve, validate, and observe the edge stack using standard Nx targets.
- Document architecture, operations, quick start, and runbook procedures so new contributors can deploy and manage the stack end-to-end.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance** – Maintain sub-50ms processing overhead for cached static assets and ensure upstream proxying supports keepalive and buffering optimizations.
- **Reliability** – Achieve 99.9% availability for edge routing by supporting zero-downtime reloads and container health checks.
- **Security** – Enforce security headers, rate limits, connection limits, and non-root execution; keep secrets outside version control.
- **Scalability** – Support horizontal scaling by running individual load balancer containers independently and enabling per-service overlays.
- **Maintainability** – Keep configuration modular and well-documented so changes can be reviewed and rolled back quickly.

## Success Metrics

- **Time to Onboard** – New service onboarding to the edge layer completed within a single working day with no bespoke configuration.
- **Availability** – Edge proxy and load balancers maintain 99.9%+ uptime during monitored pilot period.
- **Security Coverage** – 100% of exposed routes inherit baseline security headers and rate limiting.
- **Operational Efficiency** – Nx automation reduces manual steps to start/stop/reload the stack to under five commands.

## Out of Scope

- Kubernetes ingress migration or controller-based deployments (captured as a future enhancement).
- Application-level health or business logic monitoring; the epic focuses on network-layer traffic.
- Third-party CDN integration or global traffic management (handled by separate initiatives).

## Business Value

**High** – Centralizing ingress, load balancing, and security policy delivers immediate reliability gains, reduces duplicated effort across teams, and lays the groundwork for secure production deployments. The investment accelerates future feature launches, decreases incident recovery time, and ensures compliance controls are consistently applied at the edge.
