# Feature PRD — Shared Configuration Assets

## 1. Feature Name

Shared Configuration Assets

## 2. Epic

- [NGINX Edge Traffic Platform — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [NGINX Edge Traffic Platform — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Without shared configuration snippets and overlays, teams duplicate boilerplate for headers, logging, and environment-specific values, increasing drift and review burden.
- **Solution:** Provide reusable snippets (headers, logging, base), Compose overlays (development, production), and documented include patterns that keep the edge stack consistent and auditable.
- **Impact:** Configuration reuse speeds delivery, reduces defects, and ensures edge instances align with security and compliance expectations.

## 4. User Personas

- Platform Engineer — Curates snippets and overlays for the organization.
- Site Reliability Engineer — Verifies configuration consistency across environments.
- Application Engineer — Applies overlays to onboard new services with minimal custom NGINX knowledge.

## 5. User Stories

- As a platform engineer, I want header and logging snippets so that every edge component inherits required security headers.
- As an SRE, I want environment overlays that document resource limits and health checks so that production deployments stay predictable.
- As an application engineer, I want example includes and override guidance so that I can extend configuration safely.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Produce snippet files for headers, logging, and base configuration that can be included by gateway and load balancers.
  - Create Compose overlays for development and production specifying networks, env vars, and resource constraints.
  - Document include conventions and override patterns in the tool README.
  - Provide validation scripts or Nx targets to lint configuration and run `nginx -t` across overlays.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Snippets must avoid duplication and support extension via documented mechanisms.
  - Overlays must remain compatible with future containers/infrastructure updates.
  - Configuration must be version-controlled with changelog entries for significant updates.
  - Documentation must reflect repository structure and provide quick navigation links.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shared snippets reside in a central directory and are referenced by gateway and load balancer configs.
- [ ] Compose overlays enable the stack with environment-specific variables and health checks.
- [ ] Validation commands pass for all snippets and overlays, producing a single report for reviewers.
- [ ] Documentation includes include/override examples and links to relevant files.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Automated detection of unused overlays or snippets (manual review remains required).
- Organization-wide policy documentation (covered elsewhere).
- Tooling for cross-repo propagation of snippets.
