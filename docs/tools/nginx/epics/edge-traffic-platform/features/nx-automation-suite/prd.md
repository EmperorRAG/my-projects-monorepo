# Feature PRD — Nx Automation Suite

## 1. Feature Name

Nx Automation Suite

## 2. Epic

- [NGINX Edge Traffic Platform — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [NGINX Edge Traffic Platform — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Operating the edge stack manually requires multiple commands, increasing setup time and the risk of inconsistent environments.
- **Solution:** Deliver Nx targets that build images, start the stack, validate configurations, reload services, and tail logs so engineers can manage the edge via standardized workflows.
- **Impact:** Automation reduces operational toil, accelerates onboarding, and ensures CI pipelines can provision and validate the edge stack reliably.

## 4. User Personas

- Platform Engineer — Maintains the Nx project configuration and adds new targets as capabilities grow.
- Site Reliability Engineer — Uses automation for incident response, restarts, and validation.
- QA/Release Engineer — Integrates Nx commands into CI pipelines for environment bring-up and smoke tests.

## 5. User Stories

- As a platform engineer, I want Nx tasks to build and push edge images so that the pipeline stays consistent across environments.
- As an SRE, I want a single command to reload NGINX configurations and verify health so that I can respond quickly to incidents.
- As a release engineer, I want Nx tasks that validate the stack post-deploy so that CI pipelines fail fast when misconfigured.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Implement Nx targets for building images, starting/stopping the stack, running health checks, reloading configuration, and tailing logs.
  - Provide target metadata documenting options (for example, `--env=production`) and dependencies.
  - Ensure targets integrate with existing scripts (health checks, validation) and return non-zero on failure.
  - Document how to compose targets for local workflows and CI use cases.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Automation must execute within acceptable timeframes (<2 minutes for build and start sequences in development).
  - Targets must be idempotent and rerunnable without manual cleanup.
  - Commands must produce structured output suitable for CI logs.
  - Configuration should support remote caching where applicable to speed up pipelines.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `nx run edge:build` (placeholder target) builds required images and stores them locally or in the registry.
- [ ] `nx run edge:up` starts the gateway and load balancers with appropriate overlays and confirms health checks pass.
- [ ] `nx run edge:reload` triggers configuration reloads and exits non-zero on failure.
- [ ] Documentation describes each target, expected parameters, and example workflows for local and CI usage.

## 8. Out of Scope

- Nx plugin publication or generic automation outside the edge stack.
- Automatic rollback orchestration (manual procedures documented separately).
- Multi-cluster orchestration beyond the Docker Compose scope.
