# Feature PRD — Edge Operational Documentation

## 1. Feature Name

Edge Operational Documentation

## 2. Epic

- [NGINX Edge Traffic Platform — Epic PRD](../../epic.md)
- [NGINX Edge Traffic Platform — Architecture](../../arch.md)

## 3. Goal

- **Problem:** Engineers lack a single source of truth for running, troubleshooting, and auditing the edge stack, causing inconsistent operations and delayed incident response.
- **Solution:** Deliver a comprehensive documentation set (README, runbook, quick start, validation guide) covering architecture, deployment, monitoring, and incident handling.
- **Impact:** Teams ramp faster, incidents resolve quicker, and audits succeed because procedures and evidence are centralized.

## 4. User Personas

- Site Reliability Engineer — Uses runbooks and validation guides during operations.
- Platform Engineer — Maintains documentation and coordinates updates with tooling changes.
- Application Engineer — References quickstarts to integrate new services through the edge.

## 5. User Stories

- As an SRE, I want a runbook describing incident triage steps so that I can mitigate outages efficiently.
- As a platform engineer, I want architecture diagrams and topology descriptions so that newcomers understand the edge design quickly.
- As an application engineer, I want a quickstart outlining onboarding steps so that I can expose my service behind the edge safely.

## 6. Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
  - Produce README, QUICKSTART, RUNBOOK, and validation documents in the `tools/nginx` docs directory.
  - Include diagrams illustrating traffic flow, container relationships, and health monitoring hooks.
  - Link documentation to Nx targets, scripts, and configuration directories for at-a-glance navigation.
  - Provide troubleshooting sections covering common errors, log locations, and escalation paths.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
  - Documentation must follow repository style standards and include accessibility considerations (headings, tables of contents).
  - Content should be versioned with changelog entries or commit references for significant updates.
  - Examples and commands must be tested to prevent stale instructions.
  - Runbook should include verification checkpoints and decision trees.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All required documents exist with up-to-date content linked from the tool README.
- [ ] Diagrams render successfully (Mermaid or exported images) and reflect the current architecture.
- [ ] Runbook includes incident scenarios, verification steps, and escalation contacts.
- [ ] Documentation references relevant Nx targets, scripts, and configuration files for quick execution.

## 8. Out of Scope

- External customer-facing documentation (internal engineering focus only).
- Automated documentation generation or publishing (manual review cadence maintained).
- Translation into additional languages.
