## Status

Accepted

## Context

Unified health monitoring introduced new endpoints, Docker healthchecks, and Nx automation, but knowledge about how these parts interact lived in scattered README notes and tribal knowledge. Onboarding new engineers or responding to incidents required piecing together scripts, commands, and architecture diagrams from multiple locations. The health documentation suite feature delivers a consolidated documentation space, runbooks, diagrams, and changelog practices so that operational guidance stays in sync with the tooling.

## Decision

Establish the unified health documentation suite by:

- Organizing health monitoring content under `tools/nginx/docs/health/` with sections for overviews, runbooks, troubleshooting, FAQ, and changelog entries tied to code revisions.
- Capturing step-by-step runbooks that reference gateway endpoints, Docker healthchecks, and Nx tasks, including verification checkpoints and escalation guidance.
- Embedding architecture and request flow diagrams (Mermaid) that mirror the epic specification and keep engineers oriented during incident response.
- Integrating the new content into the Next.js documentation site navigation and search metadata so teams can discover and maintain it alongside other NGINX tooling docs.

## Consequences

### Positive

- POS-001 — Provides a single source of truth for health-related workflows, accelerating onboarding and reducing misconfigurations.
- POS-002 — Ensures runbooks and diagrams evolve with code changes, improving audit readiness and operational consistency.
- POS-003 — Enhances cross-team collaboration by documenting escalation paths, verification steps, and changelog context in a predictable format.

### Negative

- NEG-001 — Adds documentation maintenance overhead; engineers must update runbooks and diagrams whenever health tooling evolves.
- NEG-002 — Requires adherence to documentation linting, accessibility, and review workflows, slightly increasing effort for each change.
- NEG-003 — Risks stale instructions if ownership and review cadence are not enforced through process and tooling.

## Alternatives

- ALT-001 — Continue relying on scattered README files and informal knowledge transfer. Rejected because it perpetuates inconsistencies and slows incident response.
- ALT-002 — Outsource documentation to external wikis or ticketing platforms. Rejected due to fragmentation and lack of version control alongside code changes.
- ALT-003 — Generate docs automatically from scripts without curated runbooks. Rejected since procedural guidance and diagrams require human context and validation.

## Implementation Notes

- IMP-001 — Create markdown templates with required frontmatter (owners, lastReviewed, tags) and enforce through linting to maintain quality.
- IMP-002 — Wire the documentation folder into the Next.js docs navigation, ensuring search metadata aligns with health-related keywords.
- IMP-003 — Validate Mermaid diagrams during CI and provide guidance for rendering previews so contributors can verify visuals before merging.
- IMP-004 — Maintain a changelog documenting updates to health tooling and correlate entries with pull requests for traceability.
