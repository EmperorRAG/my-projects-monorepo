# Implementation Plan: Enforcing Code-Level Documentation Standards

## 1. Objective

The purpose of this plan is to establish and enforce a clear standard for code-level documentation. High-quality, consistent code comments are a critical source of context for both human developers and AI assistants. By mandating the use of TSDoc for all exported members, we make our codebase more self-documenting and easier for tools to understand.

This is a single-phase plan, but it requires careful modification of existing project guidelines. You should use a TODO list to ensure all steps are completed correctly.

## 2. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Contribution Guidelines with TSDoc Standards

The goal of this phase is to formally integrate TSDoc requirements into our project's contribution process.

**Tasks:**

1. **Locate and Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`:**
    * First, find the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file within the repository. It is likely located in the `.github/` directory.
    * Read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

2. **Add a "Code-Level Documentation" Section:**
    * Append a new section to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    * The new section should be titled `## Code-Level Documentation`.
    * In this section, state that the project requires TSDoc comments for all exported functions, classes, interfaces, and type aliases.

3. **Provide a Clear TSDoc Example:**
    * Within the new section, include a clear and correct example of a well-documented function using TSDoc. This example will serve as a template for developers and the AI.
    * The example should demonstrate:
        * A summary of the function's purpose.
        * `@param` tags for each parameter, including a description.
        * A `@returns` tag describing the return value.
        * An `@example` tag showing how to use the function.

    **Example to include:**

    ````markdown
    ### TSDoc Example

    All exported members must be documented using TSDoc.

    ```typescript
    /**
     * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
     *
     * @param a - The first number.
     * @param b - The second number.
     * @returns The sum of the two numbers.
     * @example
     * ```
     * const result = add(2, 3); // 5
     * ```
     */
    export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```
    ````

## 3. Validation

After you have edited the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, re-read it to ensure that the new section is correctly formatted and that the example is clear. The successful completion of this plan will mean that all future contributions will be expected to include high-quality documentation, thereby continuously enriching the context available to AI assistants.
