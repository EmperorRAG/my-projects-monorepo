# Implementation Plan: Establishing a Comprehensive Documentation System for AI Context

## 1. Objective

The goal of this plan is to establish a comprehensive set of documentation artifacts within this repository. This documentation will serve as a foundational context for AI assistants, enabling them to understand the project's architecture, conventions, and history more effectively. A well-documented project allows AI to generate more accurate code, provide better suggestions, and follow project-specific guidelines.

This is a multi-phase process. You should structure your work using a TODO list to track progress through each task.

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create Core Project Onboarding Documents

The goal of this phase is to create the essential documents that any new developer (or AI) would need to get started with the project.

**Tasks:**

1. **Create a detailed root `README.md`:**
    * The file should be located at the root of the repository.
    * If it already exists, enhance it with the following sections:
        * **Project Overview:** A high-level description of what the project is, its purpose, and its goals.
        * **Getting Started:** Detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment, including prerequisites, installation commands (e.g., `pnpm install`), and how to run the application for development (e.g., `npx nx dev my-programs-app`).
        * **Workspace Architecture:** A description of the monorepo structure, explaining the purpose of the `apps`, `libs`, and `docs` directories. Reference the Nx project graph as a source of truth for dependencies.
        * **Running Tests:** Instructions on how to execute unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the various projects in the monorepo.

2. **Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file:**
    * The file should be located in the `.github/` directory.
    * It should define the standards and procedures for contributing to the repository.
    * Include the following sections:
        * **Code of Conduct:** Link to or include a code of conduct.
        * **Pull Request Process:** Detail the steps for creating and submitting a pull request, including branch naming conventions, PR titles, and required reviewers.
        * **Coding Standards:** Mention the use of ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and quality.
        * **Commit Message Format:** Specify the conventional commit format that the project adheres to.

### Phase 2: Document Architectural and AI-Specific Guidelines

This phase focuses on creating documents that capture higher-level decisions and provide explicit instructions for AI agents.

**Tasks:**

1. **Establish an Architectural Decision Record (ADR) directory:**
    * Create a new directory at `docs/adr`.
    * This directory will hold records of significant architectural decisions.

2. **Create the first ADR as a template:**
    * Create a new file: `docs/adr/adr-0001-use-markdown-for-documentation.md`.
    * **Important:** This ADR, and all future ADRs, must be generated by following the guidelines in the `.github/prompts/create-architectural-decision-record.prompt.md` file. This ensures all ADRs are structured, detailed, and consistent.
    * The content should explain the decision to use Markdown for all documentation, citing reasons like simplicity, tool support, and readability. This file will serve as an example for future ADRs.

3. **Create an `AGENTS.md` file:**
    * Create this file in the root directory.
    * This document will be the primary source of truth for AI agents.
    * It should include:
        * A summary of the developer workflow (using `nx` for tasks).
        * A reference to the `.github/instructions` directory, explaining that it contains detailed, task-specific instructions.
        * Guidelines on how the AI should interact with the repository, such as preferring Nx generators for code scaffolding.

### Phase 3: Define Code-Level Documentation Standards

This phase is about ensuring that the code itself is a source of context.

**Tasks:**

1. **Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` with code commenting standards:**
    * Add a new section to the existing `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    * This section should mandate the use of TSDoc for all exported functions, classes, and types in TypeScript files.
    * Provide a clear example of a well-documented function.

## 3. Validation

After completing all phases, review the created files to ensure they are comprehensive, clearly written, and follow the project's formatting standards. The existence of these documents will significantly improve the context available to AI assistants, leading to better collaboration.
