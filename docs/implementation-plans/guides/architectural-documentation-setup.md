# Implementation Plan: Establishing Architectural and AI-Specific Documentation

## 1. Objective

This plan outlines the steps required to establish a formal process for documenting architectural decisions and to create a dedicated set of guidelines for AI assistants. Capturing architectural rationale in Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) provides deep context for why the system is built the way it is. A dedicated `AGENTS.md` file ensures that AI assistants can operate effectively and consistently within the repository's conventions.

This is a multi-phase process. You should structure your work using a TODO list to track progress through each task.

## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Set Up Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

The goal of this phase is to create a home for our architectural decisions and to seed it with an initial record that also serves as a template.

**Tasks:**

1. **Create the ADR Directory:**
    * Create a new directory at `docs/adr`.
    * This directory will store all future ADRs in Markdown format.

2. **Create the First ADR:**
    * Create a new file named `adr-0001-use-nx-for-monorepo-management.md` inside the `docs/adr` directory.
    * The content of this ADR should document the decision to use Nx for managing this monorepo.
    * **Important:** This ADR, and all future ADRs, must be generated by following the guidelines in the `.github/prompts/create-architectural-decision-record.prompt.md` file. This ensures all ADRs are structured, detailed, and consistent.
    * The prompt will guide the creation of the following sections:
        * **Status:** Accepted
        * **Context:** Describe the problem: managing a complex monorepo with multiple applications and libraries requires a robust build system to handle dependencies, task running, and code sharing efficiently.
        * **Decision:** State the decision: "We will use Nx as the primary tool for managing this monorepo."
        * **Consequences:** List the positive outcomes (e.g., cached builds, dependency graph visualization) and any potential negative consequences (e.g., learning curve).

### Phase 2: Create AI-Specific Guidelines

This phase focuses on creating a central document that provides explicit instructions for AI agents working within this repository.

**Tasks:**

1. **Create the `AGENTS.md` file:**
    * Create a new file named `AGENTS.md` in the root of the repository.
    * This file will serve as the primary guide for AI assistants like GitHub Copilot.
    * Populate the file with the following sections:
        * **General Guidelines for working with Nx:**
            * Explain that all tasks (build, test, lint) should be run through `nx` commands (`nx run`, `nx affected`).
            * Mention that the AI has access to Nx-specific tools (like `nx_workspace`) to get information about the repository.
        * **CI Error Guidelines:**
            * Provide a workflow for debugging CI failures using the available `nx_cloud_*` tools.
        * **Code Generation:**
            * Instruct the AI to always prefer using Nx generators (`nx g`) for creating new components, libraries, or applications.

## 3. Validation

After completing all tasks, review the newly created `docs/architectural-decision-records` directory and the `AGENTS.md` file. Ensure the ADR template is clear and that the `AGENTS.md` file provides actionable, unambiguous instructions for an AI. This setup will provide critical context on both architectural history and expected AI behavior.
