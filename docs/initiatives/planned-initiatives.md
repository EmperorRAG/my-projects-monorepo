# Planned Initiatives

This document lists the high-level initiatives derived from the various strategic plans. It serves as a master list of major initiatives to be undertaken.

## Initiative 1: Dockerized MCP Email Server

Based on the [Dockerized MCP Email Server Plan](./dockerized-mcp-email-server.md), the following epics have been identified to achieve the objective:

### Epic 1: Nest.js Email Microservice

- **Description**: A standalone microservice built with the Nest.js framework responsible for connecting to an SMTP provider and sending emails. This is the core application.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - A new Nx application (`mcp-email-server`).
  - `EmailService` for handling email logic with `Nodemailer`.
  - A RESTful API (`EmailController`) for triggering email sends.
  - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for request validation.
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### Epic 2: MCP Tool Server

- **Description**: An MCP-compliant server that wraps the Nest.js Email Microservice, exposing its functionality as a secure and well-defined tool for AI agents.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - A formal tool definition file (JSON/YAML) for the `send_email` tool.
  - Server logic to handle MCP requests, validate them, and call the email microservice.
  - Error handling and response mapping between the microservice and the MCP layer.

### Epic 3: Production-Ready Docker Environment

- **Description**: The containerization setup for both local development and production deployment.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - A multi-stage `Dockerfile` for creating optimized, secure production images.
  - A `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrating the local development environment with hot-reloading.

### Epic 4: CI/CD and Deployment Automation

- **Description**: An automated pipeline to ensure continuous integration, testing, and deployment of the email server.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions).
  - Automated steps for building the Docker image, running all tests, and pushing the image to a container registry.
  - Automated deployment scripts for a chosen hosting provider (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run).
  - Secure management of production secrets and environment variables.
