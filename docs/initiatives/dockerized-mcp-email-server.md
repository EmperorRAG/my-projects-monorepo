# Plan: Dockerized MCP Email Server (Nest.js)

This document outlines the high-level plan for creating a dockerized, Nest.js-based email server that is exposed as a tool through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This plan is intended to be used by AI models to generate detailed Project Requirement Documents (PRDs), technical specifications, Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), and implementation plans.

## 1. Objective

To design, develop, and deploy a secure, scalable, and reliable email-sending microservice. The service will be built with the Nest.js framework, containerized using Docker, and made available as a tool for AI agents to use via an MCP server.

## 2. High-Level Phases

The project is broken down into the following distinct phases.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Scaffolding

The goal of this phase is to establish a solid foundation for the new application within the existing Nx monorepo.

- **Action**: Generate a new Nest.js application.
  - **Details**: Use the appropriate Nx generator (`@nrwl/nest` or similar) to scaffold a new application (e.g., `mcp-email-server`).
- **Action**: Establish the core module structure.
  - **Details**: Create initial modules for key features, such as `EmailModule`, `ApiModule`, and `McpModule`.
- **Action**: Configure environment variables.
  - **Details**: Set up a system for managing environment variables (e.g., using a `.env` file and NestJS's `ConfigModule`) for development, testing, and production. This will include placeholders for SMTP credentials, ports, etc.

### Phase 2: Core Feature Development

This phase focuses on building the primary email-sending functionality.

- **Action**: Implement the email service.
  - **Details**: Create an `EmailService` that encapsulates the logic for connecting to an SMTP server and sending emails. Use a robust library like `Nodemailer`.
- **Action**: Develop the public API.
  - **Details**: Create a RESTful API controller (`EmailController`) with endpoints to trigger email sending (e.g., `POST /api/v1/send`).
- **Action**: Define data contracts.
  - **Details**: Create Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) with validation (e.g., using `class-validator`) for all incoming API requests to ensure data integrity.

### Phase 3: MCP Integration

This phase makes the service available as a tool for AI models.

- **Action**: Define the MCP tool specification.
  - **Details**: Create a JSON or YAML file that clearly defines the `send_email` tool, its inputs (e.g., `to`, `subject`, `body`), outputs, and a clear description for the AI model.
- **Action**: Implement the MCP server.
  - **Details**: Build the server logic that listens for MCP requests, validates them against the tool specification, and invokes the `EmailService` to perform the requested action.

### Phase 4: Dockerization

This phase focuses on containerizing the application for portability and consistent deployments.

- **Action**: Create a production-ready `Dockerfile`.
  - **Details**: Implement a multi-stage Dockerfile to create a lean, optimized production image. This involves building the application, installing only production dependencies, and copying over the final build artifacts.
- **Action**: Create a `docker-compose.yml` for development.
  - **Details**: Set up a Docker Compose file to orchestrate the local development environment, including mounting local source code for hot-reloading.

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation

This phase ensures the application is reliable and functions as expected.

- **Action**: Implement a testing suite.
  - **Details**: Write unit tests for the `EmailService`, integration tests for the API endpoints, and end-to-end (e2e) tests to validate the entire workflow in a containerized environment.
- **Action**: Perform manual validation.
  - **Details**: Manually test the email sending functionality in a staging environment to confirm emails are delivered and formatted correctly.

### Phase 6: Deployment & Hosting

This phase covers the process of making the application publicly accessible.

- **Action**: Select a hosting provider.
  - **Details**: Evaluate and choose a suitable cloud provider for hosting Docker containers (e.g., AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, DigitalOcean App Platform).
- **Action**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Details**: Set up an automated pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) that triggers on code pushes to build the Docker image, run tests, and deploy the new image to the hosting provider.
- **Action**: Configure production environment.
  - **Details**: Securely manage and inject production secrets and environment variables (e.g., SMTP credentials) into the production environment.

## 3. Key Considerations

Throughout all phases, the following aspects must be a priority:

- **Security**: Sanitize all inputs, securely manage credentials, and follow best practices for securing a Nest.js application and Docker container.
- **Scalability**: Design the application to be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and provide clear, actionable error messages.
- **Logging**: Integrate a structured logging solution to capture important events and errors for easier debugging and monitoring.
