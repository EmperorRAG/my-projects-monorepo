# ADR-0001: Use Nx for Monorepo Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project is a monorepo containing multiple applications and libraries, including a Next.js frontend, a NestJS backend, and shared utilities. Managing dependencies, builds, tests, and code generation across these projects can become complex and inefficient without a proper monorepo management tool.

## Decision

We will use Nx to manage the monorepo. Nx provides a powerful set of tools for managing complex monorepos, including dependency graphing, smart builds (only rebuilding what's affected), code generation, and consistent tooling across projects.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: **Improved Developer Experience**: Nx provides a consistent and streamlined workflow for developers working across multiple projects.
- **POS-002**: **Faster Build and Test Times**: Nx's computation caching and affected graph analysis significantly reduce build and test times.
- **POS-003**: **Enhanced Code Sharing and Consistency**: Nx makes it easy to share code between projects and enforce consistent standards.

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: **Learning Curve**: Developers new to Nx will need time to learn its concepts and commands.
- **NEG-002**: **Configuration Overhead**: Nx introduces its own configuration files (`nx.json`, `project.json`) that need to be maintained.

## Alternatives Considered

### Lerna

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: A popular tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: While Lerna is good for package publishing, it lacks the advanced features of Nx, such as computation caching and a rich plugin ecosystem.

### Yarn Workspaces / pnpm Workspaces

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: Built-in workspace features in package managers.
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: These tools primarily handle dependency management but do not provide the same level of task orchestration, code generation, and developer tooling as Nx.

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: All projects will be configured in `nx.json` and their respective `project.json` or `package.json` files.
- **IMP-002**: Developers should use `npx nx` commands for all common tasks like building, testing, and serving applications.
