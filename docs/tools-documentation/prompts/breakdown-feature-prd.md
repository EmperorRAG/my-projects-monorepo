## 5. Complexity Analysis

### High Complexity Areas

#### 5.1 User Stories (Primary Paths + Edge Cases)
**Issues:**
- **Open-ended scope:** "Cover primary paths and edge cases" has no limit
- **Edge case explosion:** Complex features can have dozens of edge cases
- **Overlap with acceptance criteria:** Similar information in two formats
- **Maintenance burden:** Many user stories = more updates

**Current Problems:**
- No guidance on number of user stories
- No framework for edge case identification
- Potential duplication with functional requirements
- Unclear when a scenario is "edge case" vs. "primary path"

**Recommendation:**
- Limit to 3-7 primary user stories
- Separate edge cases into dedicated section (not user stories)
- Provide edge case discovery checklist
- Focus user stories on happy paths

#### 5.2 Functional Requirements (Detailed & Unambiguous)
**Issues:**
- **No depth guidance:** "Detailed" and "specific and unambiguous" can lead to extreme detail
- **No quantity limits:** Can result in 50+ requirements
- **Overlaps with user stories:** Often describing same functionality differently
- **Feature vs. task blur:** May include implementation details

**Current Problems:**
- Unclear granularity level
- No template or examples
- Can become exhaustive task list
- Difficult to maintain

**Recommendation:**
- Limit to 10-15 high-level functional requirements
- Provide granularity examples (too detailed vs. just right)
- Use "MUST" vs. "SHOULD" prioritization
- Separate core from optional requirements

#### 5.3 Acceptance Criteria (For Each User Story)
**Issues:**
- **Multiplication effect:** 10 user stories × 5 criteria each = 50 criteria
- **Format inconsistency:** Choice between checklist or Given/When/Then
- **Validation overhead:** Comprehensive criteria = comprehensive testing burden
- **Over-specification:** May constrain implementation unnecessarily

**Current Problems:**
- "For each user story or major requirement" is open-ended
- Two format options cause inconsistency
- No guidance on criteria count per story
- Unclear when to use which format

**Recommendation:**
- Use ONE format consistently (Given/When/Then for behavior-focused)
- Limit to 3-5 criteria per user story
- Focus on outcomes, not implementation details
- Combine criteria for related user stories

### Medium Complexity Areas

#### 5.4 Non-Functional Requirements
**Issues:**
- Requires technical knowledge
- May duplicate Epic NFRs
- Can be generic if not thoughtfully applied

**Current Problems:**
- No guidance on Epic vs. Feature NFRs
- No template for common NFRs
- Unclear specificity level

**Recommendation:**
- Reference Epic NFRs, add only feature-specific NFRs
- Provide NFR checklist (select applicable)
- Require quantifiable targets where possible

#### 5.5 Out of Scope Definition
**Issues:**
- Requires understanding of adjacent features
- Can be overlooked
- Unclear detail level

**Current Problems:**
- No guidance on what to include
- May miss important boundaries
- Can be too detailed or too vague

**Recommendation:**
- Provide "common out-of-scope" checklist for feature types
- Focus on frequently requested additions
- Keep concise (3-5 key exclusions)

### Low Complexity Areas (Good to Keep)

#### 5.6 Feature Name & Epic Linkage
- Clear organizational value
- Low overhead
- Essential for traceability

#### 5.7 Goal Definition (Problem/Solution/Impact)
- Core PRD value
- Clear structure
- Drives feature understanding

#### 5.8 User Personas
- Standard practice
- Well-understood
- Epic alignment clear

## 6. Simplification Recommendations

### Priority 1: Streamline User Stories
**Current State:** Open-ended primary paths + edge cases coverage

**Simplified Approach:**
```markdown
## User Stories (Limit: 3-7 primary stories)

### Primary Flows
1. As a [persona], I want to [action] so that I can [benefit]
2. As a [persona], I want to [action] so that I can [benefit]
...

### Edge Cases & Exceptions (Separate section)
- [Edge case 1]: Expected behavior
- [Edge case 2]: Expected behavior
(Use checklist format for edge cases, not full user stories)
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of primary vs. edge
- Focused user stories
- Faster to write and review
- Easier to prioritize

### Priority 2: Limit and Structure Requirements
**Current State:** Open-ended detailed requirements

**Simplified Approach:**
```markdown
## Functional Requirements (Limit: 10-15 requirements)

### Core Requirements (MUST have)
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
...

### Extended Requirements (SHOULD have)
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
...

### Non-Functional Requirements (Select applicable from Epic + add feature-specific)
☐ Performance: [Specific target]
☐ Security: [Specific requirement]
☐ Accessibility: [Specific requirement]
☐ Feature-specific: [Custom NFR]
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear prioritization (MUST vs. SHOULD)
- Manageable quantity
- Epic NFR reuse
- Focused on feature-specific needs

### Priority 3: Standardize Acceptance Criteria
**Current State:** "For each user story" with dual format options

## Acceptance Criteria (3-5 criteria per user story, Given/When/Then format)

### User Story 1: [Story title]
- **Given** [context], **When** [action], **Then** [outcome]
- **Given** [context], **When** [action], **Then** [outcome]
...

### User Story 2: [Story title]
- **Given** [context], **When** [action], **Then** [outcome]
...

### Combined Criteria (For related stories)
- **Given** [context], **When** [action], **Then** [outcome]
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent format (Given/When/Then)
- Clear quantity limit
- Allows grouping for efficiency
- Behavior-focused validation

### Priority 4: Simplify Out of Scope
**Current State:** Open-ended exclusion list

## 7. Recommended Scope Reduction

### Features to Remove
1. **"For each user story" acceptance criteria** - Replace with 3-5 per story limit
2. **Dual format options** - Standardize on Given/When/Then
3. **Open-ended edge cases in user stories** - Separate edge cases section

### Features to Simplify
1. **User Stories** → Limit to 3-7 primary, separate edge cases
2. **Functional Requirements** → Limit to 10-15, add MUST/SHOULD prioritization
3. **Acceptance Criteria** → Single format, quantity limits, grouping allowed
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** → Reference Epic, add feature-specific only
5. **Out of Scope** → Checklist + custom additions

### Features to Keep (Core Value)
1. **Feature Name & Epic Linkage** - Essential traceability
2. **Goal Definition** - Core PRD value
3. **User Personas** - User-centered design
4. **All sections** - But with simplified, structured formats

## 14. Comparison: Current vs. Simplified

### Current Approach Example (User Stories + Edge Cases)
```markdown
User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to create a profile...
2. As a user, I want to edit a profile...
3. As a user, I want to view a profile...
4. As a user, I want to delete a profile...
5. As a user, I want to recover deleted profile... (edge case as story)
6. As a user, I want to handle missing data... (edge case as story)
7. As a user, I want to see validation errors... (edge case as story)
...
[10+ stories including edge cases]

Acceptance Criteria: [50+ criteria for all stories]
```

**Issues:** Edge cases mixed with primary flows, criteria explosion

### Simplified Approach Example
```markdown
Primary User Stories: (3-5)
1. As a user, I want to create a profile...
2. As a user, I want to edit my profile...
3. As a user, I want to delete my profile...

Edge Cases & Exceptions:
- Missing required fields: Show validation errors
- Deleted profile: Soft delete with 30-day recovery
- Network failure: Retry with exponential backoff

Acceptance Criteria: (3-5 per story)
Story 1:
- Given required fields, When I submit, Then profile is created
- Given missing fields, When I submit, Then see validation errors
- Given duplicate email, When I submit, Then see error message
```

**Benefits:** Clear separation, focused criteria, manageable size
