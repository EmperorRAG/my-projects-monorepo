- `nginx-proxy-edge`: Edge proxy with TLS termination
- `nginx-lb-frontend`: Frontend load balancer
- `nginx-lb-api`: API load balancer
- `nginx-lb-email`: Email service load balancer

**Configuration Files**: 20+
- 3-layer system: Base → Service → Environment
- 4 main configs, 8 overlays, 5+ snippets
- Multiple compose files (base, prod, TLS)

**Script Count**: 10
- 6 TLS management scripts
- 2 validation scripts
- 1 health check script
- 1 config validation script

**Nx Targets**: 23
- 4 build targets
- 4 compose targets
- 5 management targets
- 6 TLS targets
- 4 utility targets

#### Identified Complexity Issues

**1. Load Balancer Redundancy** ⚠️
- **Problem**: 3 separate LB containers for similar services
- **Current**: 300MB+ total memory, 3× Docker overhead
- **Impact**: Resource waste, configuration duplication, complex networking
- **Root Cause**: Over-engineering for simple routing needs

**Recommendation**: 
- Consolidate to 1-2 load balancers using virtual hosts
- Use path-based routing: `/api/*`, `/email/*`, `/app/*`
- Reduce memory footprint by 200MB
- Simplify networking (3 networks → 1-2)

**2. Three-Layer Configuration System** ⚠️
- **Problem**: Base + Service + Environment overlays
- **Current**: Changes require editing 3 files
- **Impact**: High maintenance, difficult debugging, configuration drift
- **Root Cause**: Over-abstraction without clear benefit

**Recommendation**:
- Reduce to 2 layers: Service + Environment
- Use environment variables for dynamic values
- Implement configuration templates
- Single source of truth per service

**3. TLS Script Proliferation** ⚠️
- **Problem**: 6 separate TLS scripts with overlapping functionality
- **Scripts**: 
  - `generate-dev-certs.sh`
  - `validate-certs.sh`
  - `rotate-certs.sh`
  - `install-certbot.sh`
  - `setup-letsencrypt.sh`
  - `test-install-certbot.sh`
- **Impact**: User confusion, maintenance burden, inconsistent interfaces

**Recommendation**:
- Consolidate to 3 scripts:
  - `tls-manage.sh` (generate, validate, rotate)
  - `certbot-setup.sh` (install, configure)
  - `certbot-test.sh` (validation only)
- Use subcommands: `tls-manage.sh generate|validate|rotate`
- Reduce duplication by 60%

**4. Gateway Health Check Complexity** ⚠️
- **Problem**: Routing health checks through edge proxy
- **Current**: Client → Edge → LB → Service
- **Impact**: Additional latency, complex troubleshooting, cascading failures

**Recommendation**:
- Implement direct health checks where possible
- Use Docker health checks natively
- Reserve gateway checks for external monitoring only
- Reduce check latency by 50%

**5. Nx Target Overload** ⚠️
- **Problem**: 23 Nx targets overwhelming user experience
- **Current**: Hard to discover, inconsistent naming, redundant targets
- **Impact**: Poor UX, documentation burden, learning curve

**Recommendation**:
- Group related targets with `dependsOn`
- Reduce to 12 core targets:
  - `serve`, `stop`, `restart`
  - `build`, `validate`
  - `tls:setup`, `tls:renew`, `tls:validate`
  - `health`, `logs`, `reload`, `clean`
- Hide advanced targets in docs only

| **Multiple Integration Points** | 6/10 | Medium | 30% - Standardize |
| **Monitoring Format Options** | 5/10 | Low | 60% - Single format |
| **Script Fragmentation** | 6/10 | Medium | 35% - Consolidate |

#### Current Architecture Complexity

**Installation Methods**: 2 (Native + Docker)
- Native installation with OS detection
- Docker-based certbot
- Dual maintenance burden

**Script Count**: 6
- `install-certbot.sh` (OS auto-detection)
- `setup-letsencrypt.sh` (Let's Encrypt setup)
- `validate-certbot.sh` (Configuration validation)
- `test-install-certbot.sh` (Installation testing)

- `monitor-certificates.sh` (Monitoring)

**Nx Targets**: 12
- 2 installation targets
- 5 Docker targets
- 3 management targets
- 2 monitoring targets

#### Identified Complexity Issues

**1. Dual Installation Path Overhead** ⚠️
- **Problem**: Supporting both native and Docker installation
- **Current**: 2× maintenance, 2× testing, 2× documentation
- **Impact**: Increased complexity, support burden, user confusion
- **Root Cause**: Attempting to serve all use cases

**Recommendation**:
- Standardize on Docker-first approach
- Provide native fallback documentation only
- Reduce maintenance burden by 70%
- Single Docker image supports all platforms
- Users manage Docker, we manage certbot

**2. OS Auto-Detection Complexity** ⚠️
- **Problem**: Complex platform detection supporting 7+ platforms
- **Current**: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Amazon Linux, Alpine, macOS
- **Impact**: Hard to test, platform-specific bugs, maintenance overhead

**Recommendation**:
- Focus on 3 primary platforms: Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine
- Others use Docker (already supported)
- Reduce testing matrix by 60%
- Simplify script logic significantly

**3. Monitoring Format Proliferation** ⚠️
- **Problem**: 3 different output formats (text, JSON, Prometheus)
- **Current**: `monitor-certificates.sh` supports all formats
- **Impact**: Complex script, hard to maintain, rarely used features

**Recommendation**:
- Standardize on JSON output
- Provide format conversion tools if needed
- Reduce script complexity by 50%
- Better integration with modern monitoring

**4. Script Fragmentation** ⚠️
- **Problem**: 6 separate scripts with overlapping concerns
- **Impact**: Inconsistent interfaces, duplicated code, user confusion

**Recommendation**:
- Consolidate to 4 scripts:
  - `certbot-docker.sh` (main Docker interface)
  - `certbot-setup.sh` (initial setup & integration)
  - `certbot-monitor.sh` (monitoring only)
  - `certbot-test.sh` (validation & testing)
- Use subcommands for related operations
- Reduce code duplication by 40%

**5. Multiple Integration Complexity** ⚠️
- **Problem**: Integrates with NGINX, Docker Compose, systemd, cron
- **Current**: 4 different integration paths, complex setup
- **Impact**: Fragile integrations, hard to troubleshoot

**Recommendation**:
- Standardize on Docker Compose + NGINX integration
- Provide systemd/cron as optional extensions
- Simplify default path by 50%
- Better documentation for advanced use cases

## Cross-Cutting Complexity Patterns

### 1. Over-Engineering for Edge Cases
- **Pattern**: Supporting uncommon scenarios adds 80% of complexity
- **Example**: Multiple monitoring formats, 7+ OS support
- **Impact**: Maintenance burden far exceeds usage value
- **Solution**: Focus on 80/20 rule - support 80% of use cases well

### 2. Configuration Abstraction Layers
- **Pattern**: Multiple abstraction layers without clear benefit
- **Example**: 3-layer NGINX config, multiple script entry points
- **Impact**: Difficult to debug, hard to understand
- **Solution**: Prefer explicit over implicit, reduce layers

### 3. Script Proliferation
- **Pattern**: Many small scripts instead of cohesive tools
- **Example**: 16 total scripts across both tools
- **Impact**: Fragmented UX, inconsistent interfaces
- **Solution**: Consolidate to fewer, more powerful scripts

### 4. Nx Target Explosion
- **Pattern**: Creating targets for every small operation
- **Example**: 35+ Nx targets total
- **Impact**: Overwhelming, hard to discover, poor UX
- **Solution**: Group targets, hide advanced operations

### 5. Dual-Path Maintenance
- **Pattern**: Supporting multiple ways to do the same thing
- **Example**: Native + Docker certbot, multiple health checks
- **Impact**: 2× maintenance, testing, documentation
- **Solution**: Choose one primary path, document alternatives
