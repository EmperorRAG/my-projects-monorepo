## Best Practices

### Writing Runbooks

✅ **Do**:
- Be clear and specific
- Include exact commands
- Provide expected outputs
- Add troubleshooting steps
- Test procedures regularly
- Keep them updated
- Use checklists
- Include rollback steps

❌ **Don't**:
- Assume prior knowledge
- Skip verification steps
- Ignore error cases
- Leave out context
- Use vague instructions
- Forget to update

### Using Runbooks

✅ **Do**:
- Follow steps in order
- Verify each step
- Document deviations
- Update after use
- Share learnings
- Test in staging first

❌ **Don't**:
- Skip steps
- Ignore warnings
- Proceed without verification
- Modify without testing
- Work alone on critical tasks

## Emergency Procedures

### High-Severity Incidents

1. **Assess**: Determine severity and impact
2. **Notify**: Alert on-call and stakeholders
3. **Contain**: Stop the bleeding
4. **Investigate**: Find root cause
5. **Resolve**: Fix the issue
6. **Verify**: Confirm resolution
7. **Document**: Create incident report
8. **Review**: Post-mortem analysis

### Communication

During incidents:
- Use established channels
- Provide regular updates
- Document decisions
- Coordinate with team
- Update status page _(planned)_

## Automation

### Automating Runbooks

Where possible, automate runbooks:

- **Scripts**: Shell scripts for procedures
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployments
- **Monitoring**: Auto-detection and alerts
- **Self-Healing**: Automated remediation _(planned)_

### Example Automation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated health check from runbook

check_service() {
  local service=$1
  local url=$2
  
  response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$url")
  
  if [ "$response" -eq 200 ]; then
    echo "✅ $service is healthy"
  else
    echo "❌ $service is unhealthy (HTTP $response)"
    # Trigger alert
  fi
}

check_service "Frontend" "https://app.example.com/health"
check_service "API" "https://api.example.com/health"
```

## Monitoring Integration

Link runbooks to monitoring:

- **Alerts**: Link to relevant runbooks
- **Dashboards**: Reference runbook procedures
- **Logs**: Include log analysis steps
- **Metrics**: Define threshold values

## Testing Runbooks

### Regular Testing

- **Monthly**: Test deployment runbooks in staging
- **Quarterly**: Test incident response procedures
- **Annually**: Full disaster recovery test

### Test Checklist

- [ ] All steps work as documented
- [ ] Commands produce expected output
- [ ] Rollback procedures work
- [ ] Timing estimates are accurate
- [ ] Prerequisites are complete
- [ ] Troubleshooting section is helpful

## Documentation Standards

### Required Sections

Every runbook must include:
- Overview and when to use
- Prerequisites and access requirements

## Contributing

To add a runbook:

1. Use the runbook template
2. Test all procedures
3. Get peer review
4. Update this README
5. Link from relevant docs
6. Train team members

## Maintenance

Runbooks should be:

- **Tested**: Regularly validate procedures
- **Updated**: Keep current with changes
- **Reviewed**: Quarterly documentation review
- **Improved**: Incorporate feedback and learnings

---

**Remember**: A runbook is only as good as the last time it was tested. Test regularly!
