# Python Instruction Module Index

Modular Python guidance lives under `.github/instructions/python`. Each module defines its own `applyTo` scope so that only relevant rules load for the files you touch.

## Module Directory
- `python-core.instructions.md` — Core clarity, maintainability, typing, and dependency guidance.
- `python-style.instructions.md` — PEP 8 alignment, indentation, and naming expectations.
- `python-docstrings.instructions.md` — Docstring structure plus intent-driven commenting.
- `python-testing.instructions.md` — Edge case coverage, deterministic tests, and hygiene patterns.

Add new Python modules to this directory and update the index when additional guidance is introduced.
