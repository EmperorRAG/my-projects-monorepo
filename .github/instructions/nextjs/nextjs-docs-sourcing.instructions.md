# Next.js Documentation Sourcing

## Stay Current
- Consult the latest Next.js documentation before adopting new patterns to confirm that guidance still applies to your framework version.
- Use `resolve_library_id` followed by `get_library_docs` when you need primary-source confirmation inside the workspace.

## Decision Hygiene
- Record deviations from official guidance with a short rationale so future contributors understand the trade-offs.
- Revisit long-lived areas of the codebase after major Next.js releases to ensure patterns remain supported.
