# Next.js Sample Content Policy

## Keep the Repo Production-Focused
- Avoid introducing demonstration components (for example `ModalExample.tsx`) unless a maintainer explicitly requests them.
- Prefer Storybook or external sandboxes for showcasing patterns when collaboration requires it.
- Remove temporary scaffolding after finishing a feature to prevent stale code paths.
