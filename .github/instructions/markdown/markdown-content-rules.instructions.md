# Markdown Content Rules

## Required Practices
- Use level-two (`##`) and deeper headings to structure documents; avoid `#` headings because site templates inject titles.
- Format lists with `-` for bullets or `1.` for ordered lists and ensure nested items use two-space indents.
- Provide fenced code blocks with language hints (start the fence with three backticks followed by the language name) so syntax highlighting works.
- Create links using square brackets for the label followed by parentheses containing the destination, and pair images with descriptive alt text inside the brackets.
- Build tables using Markdown pipes and include header rows to keep validators satisfied.
- Keep lines under 400 characters to preserve readability in reviews.
