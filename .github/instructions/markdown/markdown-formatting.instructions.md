# Markdown Formatting & Structure

## Headings
- Start sections at level-two headings (two hash symbols) and proceed hierarchically to deeper levels without skipping.
- Keep heading text concise and descriptive; avoid trailing punctuation.

## Lists & Tables
- Indent nested lists by two spaces and keep bullet style consistent within a list.
- Align table columns with pipes and provide header rows to satisfy renderers and validators.

## Whitespace & Line Length
- Insert blank lines around headings, lists, and code blocks for readability.
- Wrap prose at roughly 80 characters to simplify reviews while staying under the 400-character limit.
