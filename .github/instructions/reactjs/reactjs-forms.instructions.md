# React Forms & Validation

## Controlled Inputs
- Prefer controlled components for predictable state; document default values clearly.
- Use established libraries (React Hook Form, Formik) when forms become complex or require advanced validation.

## Accessibility
- Associate labels with inputs and provide ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Debounce expensive validation logic and deliver error messaging that helps users recover quickly.
