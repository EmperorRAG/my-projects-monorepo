# React Testing Expectations

## Strategy
- Write unit tests with React Testing Library and Jest, focusing on observable behavior rather than implementation details.
- Mock external dependencies and API calls to keep tests deterministic.

## Coverage
- Add integration tests for complex interactions or shared providers.
- Test accessibility affordances and keyboard navigation, not just visual outcomes.
