# React Styling Practices

## Approach
- Use CSS Modules, Tailwind, or the project's chosen CSS-in-JS solution consistently across features.
- Design with a mobile-first mindset and ensure components remain responsive at common breakpoints.

## Semantics & Accessibility
- Pair visual styling with semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Use design tokens or CSS custom properties for shared spacing, typography, and color systems.
