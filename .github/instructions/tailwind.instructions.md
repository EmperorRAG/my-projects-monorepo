# Tailwind Instruction Module Index

Tailwind guidance is organized into modular instruction files under `.github/instructions/tailwind` so the assistant can load only the rules relevant to the files in play.

## Module Directory
- `tailwind-styling.instructions.md` â€” Applies to `**/*.{tsx,jsx,css,pcss}` and documents palette usage, responsive utilities, dark mode, and composition tips.

Add new Tailwind modules to this directory and extend the index when additional guidance is required.
