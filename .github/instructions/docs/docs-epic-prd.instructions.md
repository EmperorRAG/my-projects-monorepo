# Epic PRD Instructions

## Do

-   Use the prompt-defined structure: Epic Name, Goal (Problem/Solution/Impact), Personas, User Journeys, Business Requirements, Success Metrics, Out of Scope, Business Value.
-   Rely on `docs/documentation-structure-reference.md` to determine the correct directory for the epic before saving it.
-   Ask clarifying questions when epic context is insufficient before drafting.
-   Ensure functional vs non-functional requirements are distinct bullet lists and cover both business and quality expectations.
-   Describe success metrics with measurable KPIs aligned to the problem statement.

## Don’t

-   Don’t proceed if the epic idea lacks enough detail; request more input first.
-   Don’t collapse Problem/Solution/Impact into a single paragraph—keep them separated as required.
-   Don’t add implementation details; the PRD remains product-centric.
-   Don’t include sections or terminology that conflict with the PRD prompt without stakeholder alignment.
