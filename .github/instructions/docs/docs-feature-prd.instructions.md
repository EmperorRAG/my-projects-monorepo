# Feature PRD Instructions

## Do

-   Follow the Feature PRD outline: Feature Name, Epic links, Goal (Problem/Solution/Impact), Personas, User Stories, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Out of Scope.
-   Link to parent epic PRD and architecture files in the Epic section.
-   Capture user stories in the required “As a…, I want…, so that…” format and cover edge cases.
-   Separate functional and non-functional requirements with specific, testable bullets.
-   Draft acceptance criteria in checklist or Given/When/Then form aligned with each major requirement.
-   Consult `docs/documentation-structure-reference.md` when determining where the Feature PRD should live.

## Don’t

-   Don’t generate a feature PRD without referencing the epic context provided by product.
-   Don’t merge acceptance criteria with requirements—keep them distinct for validation.
-   Don’t introduce technical solution details; remain focused on product expectations.
-   Don’t forget to mark out-of-scope items to prevent scope creep.
