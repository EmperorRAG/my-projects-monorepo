# Python Documentation Patterns

## Docstrings
- Follow PEP 257: first line is a summary, followed by a blank line and any detailed explanation.
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions for public functions so consumers understand usage.

## Comments
- Explain intent rather than restating the code, and remove obsolete comments during refactors.
