# Python Style & Formatting

## PEP 8 Alignment
- Use 4 spaces for indentation and keep lines within 79 characters.
- Separate logical sections with blank lines and place docstrings immediately after `def` or `class` statements.

## Naming
- Apply snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes, and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
