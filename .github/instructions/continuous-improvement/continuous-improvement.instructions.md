# Continuous Improvement Instructions Cache

This file serves as a temporary cache for instructions that AI models must follow during development. Instructions captured here will be reviewed and sorted into their appropriate permanent instruction files at a later point.

## Purpose

- **Temporary Storage**: Capture new patterns, learnings, and best practices as they emerge
- **Centralized Reference**: Provide a single location for AI models to check for recent guidance
- **Staged Migration**: Allow instructions to be refined before being moved to permanent locations

## Usage

When AI models encounter new patterns or requirements that should be documented:

1. Add the instruction to this file with context
2. Include the date and scenario where the instruction applies
3. Mark instructions that have been migrated to permanent files
4. Periodically review and migrate instructions to appropriate permanent instruction files

## Instructions

<!-- Add new instructions below this line -->

1. When implementing code, documentation must always be contained within the code's JSDoc comment unless it has either been conveyed implicitly or explicitly that the AI model may ignore this instruction when prompted.
2. When implementing code, you must never include examples outside of the code's JSDoc comment unless it has either been conveyed implicitly or explicitly that the AI model may ignore this instruction when prompted.

## Migration Log

<!-- When instructions are migrated, move them here with references to their new location -->
