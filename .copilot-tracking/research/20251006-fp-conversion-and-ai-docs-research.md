# Task Research Notes: FP Conversion and AI Documentation

## Research Executed

### File Analysis
- *No findings yet.*

### Code Search Results
- *No findings yet.*

### External Research
- #fetch:https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html
  - Reviewed official TypeScript documentation on functions. Key information gathered includes the syntax for named functions, anonymous functions, arrow functions, function types, and how `this` is handled in arrow functions. Arrow functions capture the `this` of the context where they are created, which is a key aspect of FP.
- #githubRepo:"gcanti/fp-ts"
  - Discovered `fp-ts`, a popular library for typed functional programming in TypeScript.
  - **Important:** The `fp-ts` project is merging with the `Effect-TS` ecosystem. `Effect-TS` is considered the successor to `fp-ts`. This is a major finding and suggests that new development should likely use `Effect-TS`.
  - `fp-ts` provides common functional programming data types (`Option`, `Either`), type classes (`Functor`, `Monad`), and abstractions.
- #fetch:https://effect.website/docs/introduction
  - The `Effect-TS` documentation provides a special `llms.txt` file specifically for consumption by Large Language Models. This is a major discovery for documenting the project for AI models.
- #fetch:https://effect.website/docs/getting-started/building-pipelines
  - Found detailed documentation on the `pipe` function in `Effect-TS`. `pipe` is used for left-to-right function composition.
  - `Effect-TS` also provides `map`, `flatMap`, `andThen`, and `tap` for working with `Effect` types in a pipeline.
  - The documentation emphasizes functions over methods for better tree-shakeability and extensibility.
  - There is no prominent `compose` function; `pipe` is the preferred method for composition.

### Implementation Patterns

#### Arrow Functions
From the TypeScript documentation, arrow functions provide a concise syntax and handle `this` lexically.

- **Standard function:**
  ```typescript
  function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
  }
  ```

- **Anonymous function:**
  ```typescript
  let myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
  };
  ```

- **Arrow function (nameless):**
  ```typescript
  let myAdd: (baseValue: number, increment: number) => number = function(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  };

  // Or more concisely
  const add = (x: number, y: number): number => x + y;
  ```

#### Functional Programming Libraries
- **fp-ts**: A library for typed functional programming in TypeScript. It is being merged into `Effect-TS`.
- **Effect-TS**: The successor to `fp-ts`. It is recommended for new projects. We should investigate this library for `pipe` and `compose` functionality.

#### Function Composition in Effect-TS
- **`pipe`**: The primary way to compose functions in `Effect-TS`. It allows for a readable, left-to-right flow of data.
  ```typescript
  import { pipe } from "effect"

  const increment = (x: number) => x + 1
  const double = (x: number) => x * 2

  const result = pipe(5, increment, double) // result is 12
  ```
- **`compose`**: Not a primary function in `Effect-TS`. The documentation and community favor `pipe`.

#### AI-Readable Documentation
- The `Effect-TS` project provides a `llms.txt` file. This file is a template for how to provide documentation to AI models. This is a significant finding for the second part of the user's request.
